<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span><span class='sc'>LIVIA GALE</span> leaned back in her chair at the
end of the dining-room table, and looked first
at the elderly gentleman on her right, and then
at the elderly gentleman on her left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re both of you as kind as can be, and I’m more
than grateful for all you’ve done; but I do wish you’d
see that it’s no use arguing. It only hurts and makes
us tired. Do help yourself, Mr. Trivett. And—another
cup of tea, Mr. Fenmarch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fenmarch, on her left, passed his cup with a sigh.
He was a dusty, greyish man, his face covered with an
indeterminate growth of thin short hair. His eyes were
of a dull, unspeculative blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As your solicitor, my dear Olivia,” said he, “I can
only obey instructions. As the friend of your family,
I venture to give you advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the deuce your father didn’t tie you up in a
trusteeship till you were twenty-five, at any rate,” said
Mr. Trivett on her right, helping himself to whisky
and soda—the table, covered with a green baize cloth,
was littered with papers and afternoon refreshments.
“Why the dickens——” he began again after a sizzling
gulp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s most unfortunate,” said Mr. Fenmarch,
cutting off his friend’s period. “And what you are going
to do with yourself, all alone in the world, with this
enormous amount of liquid money is more than I can
imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia smiled and tapped the blue-veined hand that
set down his teacup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you can’t. If imagination ran away with
a solicitor, it would land him in the workhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where it will land you, Olivia,” said Mr. Trivett.
“Common sense is the better mount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s rather neat,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it wasn’t, I wouldn’t have said it,” retorted Mr.
Trivett, sinking his red jowls into his collar, which made
them redder than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re so quick and clever,” said Olivia, “that I can’t
understand why you won’t see things from my point of
view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to learn that a man of experience can’t
take the view of a wrong-headed young woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Trivett emphasized the asperity of his tone by
a thump of his palm on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, he was genuinely angry. He was
the senior partner in Trivett and Gale, Auctioneers and
Estate Agents, in the comfortable little Shropshire town
of Medlow; or rather the only surviving partner, for
Gale, Olivia’s father, and his two sons had one after the
other been wiped out in a recent world accident. Olivia’s
decision, inspired from no other fount he could think of
than lunacy, involved the withdrawal of considerable
capital from the business. This, of course, being an
honourable man, he could not dispute; but here were peace
and reconstruction and inflated prices, and heaven knew
how much percentage on the middleman’s capital, and
here was this inexperienced girl throwing away a safe
income and clamouring for a settlement in full. They
had argued and argued. It may be stated here that
Mr. Trivett was the Executor of her father’s estate,
which made his position the more delicate and exasperating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Mr. Trivett’s exasperation reached the table-thumping
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia smiled wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s such a pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s a pity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, everything. One thing is that there’s no more
gold. Of course, I know you can’t understand. But
that’s your fault, not mine. I should have liked to realize
all that I’ve got in sovereigns. Do you think they’d
fill a bath? Have you ever thought how lovely it would
be to wallow in a bath of sovereigns? Treasury notes
are not the same thing. They’re either very dirty and
smell of plumbers, or very new and smell of rancid oil.
Gold is the real basis of Romance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put her down for a mere female fool, and replied
practically:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll not see a gold coin in England again for the
next fifty years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” she said; “anyhow, there’s still some
romance in mounting the deadly breech of the bank
counter with a drawn cheque in one’s hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid, my dear Olivia,” said Mr. Fenmarch
mildly, “I don’t quite see what we’re talking about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we’ve discussed it every day for the last three
months,” cried Olivia, “and now this is the very last end
of everything. A final settlement, as you call it! That’s
what you two dears have come for, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunately, yes,” said Mr. Fenmarch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it’s all so simple. You’ve shown me this”—she
picked up a foolscap document and dropped it—“the
full statement of account of my father’s estate, and
I approve—I being the only person concerned. You’ve
got to give me one last cheque for that amount”—she
tapped the document—“and I give you my receipt,
signed over a penny stamp—you’ll have to stand me a
penny stamp, for I’ve only got three-halfpenny ones in
the house—and there’s an end of the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My clerk made out the receipt and put the penny
stamp on,” said Mr. Fenmarch, untroubled by her smile.
“Here it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Solicitors’ clerks seem to think of everything,” said
Olivia. “Fancy his remembering the penny stamp!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s charged up against you, in Fenmarch’s bill—item
‘sundries,’ ” remarked Mr. Trivett, pointing a fat forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, naturally. Why should Mr. Fenmarch shower
pennies on me? It’s the delicate thoughtfulness that I
admire. I hope you’ll raise that young man’s salary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fenmarch looked pained, like a horse to whom one
had offered wooden oats, and swung his head away. Mr.
Trivett opened his mouth to speak, but before he spoke
finished his whisky and soda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Olivia,” said he, “I’m sorry to see you so
flippant. You’ve disappointed me and Mrs. Trivett
who’ve known you since you were born, more than I can
say. Until your poor mother died—God bless her—we
thought you the most capable, level-headed young woman
in this town. But for the last three months—you’ll forgive
my freedom in saying so—you have shown yourself
to be quite impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, angry. Olivia smiled and drummed on the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have some more whisky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t,” he said in a loud voice. “Whisky’s too
expensive to ladle out in that offhand fashion. It’s a
luxury, as you’ll jolly well soon discover. I’m talking for
your good, Olivia. That’s why Fenmarch and I are here.
Two minutes will wind up the business. But we have
your interests at heart, my girl, and we want to make a
last appeal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She covered with hers the back of his red-glazed hand
and spoke in a softened voice:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know, I know. I’ve said already that you and
Mr. Fenmarch were dears. But what would you have
me do? I’m twenty-three. Alone in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your uncle and aunt at Clapham,” said Mr.
Trivett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve also some sort of relations in the monkey cage
at the Zoo,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The repartee to the effect that it was the fittest home
for her only occurring to Mr. Trivett when he was getting
into bed that night, he merely stared at her gaspingly.
She continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m absolutely alone in the world. Do you think it
reasonable for me to stay in this dull old house, in this
mouldering old town, where one never sees a man from
one year’s end to another, living for the rest of my life
on the few hundreds a year which I could get if my capital
were properly invested?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t grant your premises, Olivia,” said Mr. Fenmarch.
“ ‘The Towers’ may be old, but it is not dull.
Medlow is not mouldering, but singularly progressive,
and the place seems to—to pullulate with young men. So
I think our advice to you is eminently reasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Olivia. “That’s where all the
trouble comes in. Our ideas of dullness, mouldering and
pullu—what you call it; don’t correspond. Mother was
very fond of a story of Sydney Smith. Perhaps she told
you. He was walking one day with a friend through the
slums and came across two women quarrelling across
the street, through opposite windows. And Sydney Smith
said: ‘They’ll never come to an agreement, because they
are arguing from different premises.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have a drop more whisky,” said Mr. Trivett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I see the point of the remark,” said Mr. Fenmarch
greyly. “It was a play on the two meanings of
the word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was what my mother gave me to understand,”
said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after another spell of chill silence, she cried,
her nerves on edge:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let us come to the end of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will,” said Mr. Trivett impressively. “But not
before I’ve made a few remarks in protest, with Fenmarch
as witness. I’m sorry there’s not another witness——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll get one!” cried Olivia. “Myra—the faithful
Myra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra’s a servant, also a fool; and you’ve got her under
your thumb,” said Mr. Trivett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said Olivia, “we’ll give Myra a miss.
But I know what you’re going to say—and the kind heart
that makes you say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A touch of real tenderness crept into her fine dark
eyes and almost softened Mr. Trivett. She looked so
young, so slender, so immature in her simple mourning.
Her soft black hair clustered over her forehead in a
manner which he felt was inconsistent with a woman fighting
her way alone in the world. She hadn’t a bit of
colour in her cheeks; wanted feeding up, he thought. She
was capable enough in her own sphere, the management
of her house, the care of a bed-ridden mother, the appreciation
of legal technicalities. Until she had got this bee
in her bonnet he had admired her prodigiously; though,
with the reserve which every Englishman makes in his
admiration, he deplored the shrewdness of her tongue.
But this idea of hers, to realize all her money in hard
cash at the bank and go off into unknown perils was
preposterous. She was not fit for it. You could take
her by the neck in one hand and by the waist in another
and break her to bits.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was a good, honest man
with fatherly instincts developed by the possession of
daughters of his own, strapping red-cheeked girls, who
had stayed soberly at home until the right young man
had come along and carried them off to modest homes of
unimpeachable respectability. So when he met the
tenderness in Olivia’s eyes he mitigated the asperities of
his projected discourse and preached her a very human
little sermon. While he spoke, Mr. Fenmarch nodded his
unhumorous head and stroked the straggling grey hairs
on his cheek. When he had ended, Mr. Fenmarch seconded,
as it were, the resolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Olivia thanked them prettily, promised to avoid
extravagance, and, in case of difficulty, to come to them
for advice. The final cheque was passed over, the final
receipt signed across the penny stamp provided with
such forethought, and Olivia Gale entered into uncontrolled
possession of her fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men rose to take their leave. Olivia held the hand
of the burly red-faced man who had been her father’s
partner and looked up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, if you could have your way, you would give
me a good hiding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed grimly. “Not the least doubt of it.” Then
he patted her roughly on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Mr. Fenmarch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He regarded her drearily. “After a long experience
in my profession, Olivia, I have come to one conclusion—clients
are a mistake. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone, Olivia stood for a moment wondering
whether, after all, the dusty lawyer had a jaded sense of
humour. Then she turned and caught up the cheque
and sketched a few triumphant dancing steps. Suddenly,
holding it in her hand, she rushed out into the hall, where
the men were putting on their overcoats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve forgotten the most important thing, Mr.
Trivett. You wrote me something about an offer for
the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An enquiry—not an offer,” replied Mr. Trivett. “Yes.
I forgot to mention it. A Major somebody. Wait——”
He lugged out a fat pocket-book which he consulted.
“That’s it. Major Olifant. Coming down here to-morrow
to look over it. Appointment at twelve, if that suits
you. Unfortunately, I’ve an engagement and can’t show
him round. But I’ll send Perkins, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Major wants to eat me, he’ll eat up poor little
Mr. Perkins, too,” said Olivia. “So don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waited until Myra, the maid, had helped them into
their overcoats and opened the front door. After final
leavetakings, they were gone. Olivia put up her hands,
one of them still holding the cheque, on Myra’s gaunt
shoulders and shook her and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve beaten them at last. I knew I should. Now you
and I are going to have the devil’s own time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have, Miss Olivia,” said Myra, withdrawing
like a wooden automaton from the embrace, “the time
we’ll be deserving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra was long, lean, and angular, dressed precisely
in parlourmaid’s black; but the absence of cap on her
faultlessly neat iron grey hair and the black apron suggested
a cross between the housekeeper and personal
maid. She shared, with a cook and a vague, print-attired
help, the whole service of the house. The fact
of Myra had been one of the earliest implanted in the
consciousness of Olivia’s awakening childhood. Myra
was there, perdurable as father and mother, as Polly, the
parrot, whose “Drat the child” of that morning was the
same echo of Myra’s voice, as it was when, at the age
of two, she began to interpret the bird’s articulate speech.
And, as far as she could remember, Myra had always
been the same. Age had not withered her, nor had custom
staled her infinite invariability. She had been
withered since the beginning of time, and she had been
as unchanging in aspect and flavour as Olivia’s lifelong
breakfast egg. Myra’s origins were hidden in mystery.
A family legend declared her a foundling. She had come
as a girl from Essex, recommended by a friend, long
since dead, of Mrs. Gale. She never spoke of father,
mother, sisters, and brothers; but every year, when she
took her holiday, she was presumed to return to her native
county. With that exception she seemed to have far
less of a private life than the household cat. It never
occurred to Olivia that she could possibly lead an independent
existence. Her age was about forty-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They think I’m either mad or immoral,” said Olivia.
“Thank God, they’re not religious, or they’d be holding
prayer meetings over me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might do worse,” replied Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed. “So you disapprove, too, do you?
Well, you’ll have to get over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got over many things—one more or less don’t
matter. And if I were you, Miss, I wouldn’t stand in this
draughty hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that I’m thinking of,” said Olivia, in high good
humour, “is that, with you as duenna, I shall look too
respectable. No one will believe it possible for any one
except an adventuress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I gather you’re going to be,” said Myra.
If she had put any sting into her words it would have
been a retort. But no one knew what emotions guided
Myra’s speech. With the same tonelessness she would
have proclaimed the house to be on fire, or dinner to be
ready, or the day to be fine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you don’t like the prospect, Myra, you
needn’t come,” said Olivia. “I’ll easily find something
fluffy in short skirts and silk stockings to do for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re wasting gas, Miss,” said Myra, pulling the
little chain of the bye-pass and thereby plunging the hall
in darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bother you!” cried Olivia, stumbling into the
passage and knocking against the parrot’s cage outside
the dining-room door, and Polly shrieked out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drat the child! Drat the child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before entering the dining-room she aimed a Parthian
shot at Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you agree with the little beast. Well, the
two of you’ll have to look after each other, and I wish
you joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cleared the dining-room table of the tea things and
the whisky and glasses and the superfluous papers, and
opened the window to let out the smell of Mr. Trivett’s
strong cigar, and crossed the passage to the drawing-room
opposite, where a small fire was still burning. And
there, in spite of the exultation of her triumph over Mr.
Trivett and Mr. Fenmarch, she suddenly felt very dreadfully
alone; also just a whit frightened. The precious
cheque, symbol of independence, which she had taken up,
laid down, taken up again, during her little household
duties, fell to the ground as she lay in the arm-chair by
the fireside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was her victory, and all it implied, that of a reasonable
being and a decent girl, or that of a little fool and a hussy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the mother whom she worshipped and to whom
she had devotedly sacrificed the last four years of her
young life was the inspiration of her revolt. For her
mother had been a highly bred woman, of a proud old
Anglo-Indian family, all Generals and Colonels and Sirs
and Ladies, whose names had been involved in the history
of British India for generations; and when she threw the
Anglo-Indian family halo over the windmills and married
young Stephen Gale, who used to stand in the market-place
of Medlow and bawl out the bidding for pigs and
sheep, the family turned her down with the Anglo-Indian
thoroughness that had compelled her mother to lose her
life in a plague-stricken district and her father to lose
his on the North-West Frontier. The family argument
was simple. When you—or everything mattering that
means you—have ruled provinces and commanded armies
and been Sahibs from the beginning of Anglo-Indian
time, you can’t go and marry a man who sells pigs at auction,
and remain alive. None of the family deigned to
gauge the personal value of the pig-seller. The Anglo-Brahmin
lost caste. It is true that, afterwards, patronizing
efforts were made by Brahminical uncles and aunts
and cousins to bridge over the impassable gulf; but Mrs.
Gale, very much in love with her pig-selling husband,
snapped her fingers at them and told them, in individually
opposite terms, to go hang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a love match right enough. And a love match
it remained to the very end of all things; after she had
borne him two sons and a daughter; all through the
young lives of the children; up to the day when the telegram
came announcing the death of their elder son—the
younger had been killed in the curious world accident a
month or so before—and Stephen Gale stood by her bedside—she
had even then succumbed to her incurable
malady—and said, shaken with an emotion to which one
does not refer nowadays:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary, my dear, what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she, the blood in her speaking—the blood that had
given itself at Agra, Lucknow, Khandahar, Chitral—replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, sitting by, gripped her young hands in mingled
horror and grief and passionate wonder. And Stephen
Gale, just fifty, went out to avenge his sons and do what
was right in his wife’s eyes—for his wife was his country
incarnate, her voice, being England’s voice. A love match
it was and a love match it remained while he stuck it
for two or three years—an elderly man at an inglorious
Base, until he died of pneumonia—over there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gale had lingered for a year, and, close as their
relations had been all Olivia’s life, they grew infinitely
closer during this period of bereavement. It was only
then that the mother gave delicate expression to the nostalgia
of half a lifetime, the longing for her own kind, and
the ways and thoughts and imponderable principles of
her own caste. And, imperceptibly, Olivia’s eyes were
opened to the essential differences between her mother
and the social circle into which she had married. Olivia,
ever since her shrewd child’s mind began to appreciate
values, knew perfectly well that the Trivetts and the
Gales were not accounted as gentlefolk in the town. She
early became aware of the socially divided line across
which she could not pass so as to enter Blair Park, the
high-class girls’ school on the hill, but narrowed her to
Landsdowne House, where the daughters of the tradespeople
received their education. And when the two
crocodiles happened to pass each other on country walks
she hated the smug, stuckup Blair Park girls with their
pretty blue and white ribbons round their straw hats, and
hated her red ribbon with “LH” embroidered on it, as a
badge of servitude. When she grew up she accepted
countless other social facts as immutable conditions of
existence. Mortals were divided by her unquestioning
father into three categories—“the swells,” “homely folk
like ourselves,” and “common people.” So long as each
member of the three sections knew his place and respected
it, the world was as comfortable a planet as sentient being
could desire. That was one factor in his worship of his
wife: she had stepped from her higher plane to his and had
loyally, unmurmuringly identified herself with it. He had
never a notion, good man, of the shocks, the inner wounds,
the instinctive revolts, the longings that she hid behind
her loving eyes. Nor had Olivia; although as a schoolgirl
she knew and felt proud that her mother really belonged
to Blair Park and not to Landsdowne House. As
she grew up, she realized her mother’s refining influence,
and, as far as young blood would allow, used her as a
model of speech and manner. And during the long invalid
years, when she read aloud and discussed a wide
range of literature, she received unconsciously a sensitive
education. But it was only in this last poignant intimacy,
when they were left starkly alone together, that she
sounded the depths of the loyal, loving, and yet strangely
suffering woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember once, long ago, when you were a mite of
five,” Mrs. Gale had said in a memorable confidence, “we
were staying at a hotel in Eastbourne, and I got into
conversation on the verandah with a Colonel somebody—I
forget his name—with whom we had spoken several
times before—one of those spare brown, blue-eyed men,
all leather and taut string, that wear their clothes like
uniform. You see, I was born and bred among them,
dear. And we talked and we talked and I didn’t know
how the time flew, and I missed an appointment with
your father in the town. And he came and found us together—and
he was very angry. It was the only time
in our lives he said an unkind word to me. It was the
only time I gave him any sort of cause for jealousy. But
he really hadn’t. It was only just the joy of talking to
a gentleman again. And I couldn’t tell him. It would
have broken his dear heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first flashlight across her mother’s soul,
and in its illumination vanished many obscure and haunting
perplexities of her girlhood. Had Mrs. Gale lived
the normal life of women, surrounded by those that
loved her, she would doubtless have gone to her grave
without revealing her inner self to living mortal. But infinite
sorrow and the weakness engendered by constant
physical pain had transformed her into a spirituality just
breathing the breath of life and regarding her daughter
less as a woman than as a kindred essence from whom
no secrets could be hid. At her bedside Olivia thus
learned the mystery of birth and life and death. Chiefly
the mystery of life, which appealed more to her ardent
maidenhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when at last her mother faded out of existence and
Olivia’s vigil was over, she faced a world of changing
values with a new set of values of her own. She could
not formulate them; but she was acutely conscious that
they were different from those of the good, honest Mr. Trivett
and the dull and honourable Mr. Fenmarch, and that
to all the social circle which these two represented they
would be unintelligible. In a way, she found herself
possessed of a new calculus in which she trusted to solve
the problems which defied the simple arithmetic of the
homely folk of Medlow.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>All these memories and vague certainties passed through
the girl’s mind as she sat before the fire in self-examination
after her victory, and conflicted with the prosaic
and indicatively common-sense arguments of her late
advisers. She knew that father and brothers, all beloved
and revered, would have been staunchly on the side of the
Trivetts. On the other hand, her mother, as she had
said to her husband on the edge of a far, far greater adventure,
would have said: “Go, dear.” Of that she had
no doubt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet it meant cutting herself adrift from
Medlow and all its ways and all its associations. It
meant a definite struggle to raise herself from her father’s
second social category to the first. It meant, therefore,
justifying herself against odious insinuations on the part
of her scant acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the youth in her rose insistent. During all
these years of stress and fever which had marked her
development from child into woman she had done nothing
but remain immured within the walls familiar from her
babyhood. Other girls had gone afar, in strange independence,
to vivid scenes, to unforgettable adventures, in
the service of their country, in the service of mankind—just
as her brothers and father had gone—and she had
stayed there, ineradicable, in that one little tiny spot.
The sick-room, the kitchen, the shops in Old Street, where,
in defiance of Food Controller, she had fought for cream
and butter and eggs and English meat so that her mother
could live; the sick-room again, the simple white and
green bedroom which meant to her little more than the
sleep of exhaustion; the sick-room once more, with its
pathos of spiritual love and physical repulsion—such had
been the iron environment of her life. Sorrow after sorrow,
and mourning after mourning had come, and the
little gaieties of the “homely folk” of her father’s definition
had gone on without her participation. And her
girl friends of Landsdowne House had either married rising
young tradesmen in distant towns, or had found
some further scope for their energies at the end of the
Great Adventure and were far away. In the meanwhile
other homely folk whom she did not know had poured
into the town. All kinds of people seemed to be settling
there, anyhow, without rhyme or reason. It was only
when there was not a house to be rented in the neighbourhood
that she understood why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a comfortable home of your own. Why,
on earth, don’t you stay in it?” Mr. Trivett had asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had stayed in it, alone, for the three months
since her mother’s death, waiting on the law’s delays;
and those three months had been foretaste enough of
the dreary infinite years that would lie before her, should
she remain. She was too young, too full of sap, to face
the blight of sunlessness. She longed for the sights and
the sounds and the freedom of the great world. What
she would do when she got into it, she did not exactly
know. Possibly she might meet a fairy prince. If such
a speculation was that of a hussy, why then, she argued,
all women are hussies from birth. As for being a fool
for defying advice on the proper investment of her money—well,
perhaps she was not quite such a fool as Mr.
Trivett imagined. If she did not spend her capital, it
would be just as safe lying on deposit at the bank as invested
in stocks and shares; safer, for she had lately had
wearisome experience of the depreciation of securities.
She would not be senselessly extravagant; in fact, with
the sanguineness of youth she hoped to be able to live on
the interest on her deposit and the rent of the furnished
house. But behind her, definite, tangible, uninfluenced
by Stock Exchange fluctuations, would be her fortune.
And then—a contingency which she did not put before
Mr. Trivett and Mr. Fenmarch, for a woman seldom discloses
her main argument to a male adversary—there
might come a glorious moment in some now unconjecturable
adventure when it might be essential for her to
draw cheques for dazzling sums which she could put in
her pocket and go over mysterious hills and far away.
She stood on the edge of her dull tableland and gazed
wide-eyed at the rolling Land of Romance veiled by gold
and purple mist. And in that Land, from immemorial
time, people carried their money in bags, into which they
dipped their hands, as occasion required, and cast the unmeaning
counters at the feet of poverty or into the lap of
greed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she sat down to her solitary supper, she had decided
that she was neither hussy nor fool. She held
baffling discourse with Myra, who could not be enticed
into enthusiasm over the immediate future. Teasing
Myra had been her joy from infancy. She sketched their
career—that of female Don Quixote and Sancho Panza—that
of knights of old in quest of glorious adventure.
She quoted, mock heroically:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ride abroad redressing human wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better redress the young London women which I see
the pictures of in the illustrated papers,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia laughed. “You are a dear old blessing, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure of it,” said Myra, with an expressionless face.
“Anyways, you’re not going to buy one of them things
when you get to London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” replied Olivia. “And you’ll have to help me
put it on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t help folks put on nothing,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think you’ll do when you’re really
shocked?” asked Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never think what I’ll do,” replied Myra. “It’s
waste of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia enjoyed her supper.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>T</span> was only when she waited the next morning for her
possible tenant, the Major Olifant of whom Mr.
Trivett had spoken, and went through the familiar
rooms to see that they were fit for alien inspection, that
she realized the sacrilege which she was about to commit.
Every room was sacred, inhabited by some beloved ghost.
The very furniture bore landmarks of the wear and tear
of those that were dead. To say nothing of the beds on
which they had slept, the chairs in which they had sat,
which still seemed to retain the impress of their forms,
there persisted a hundred exquisitely memorable trivialities.
The arm of the oak settle in the hall still showed
the ravages of the teeth of Barabbas, the mongrel bull-terrier
pup introduced, fifteen years ago, into the house,
by Charles her elder brother; an animal who, from being
cursed by the whole family for a pestilential cur, wriggled
his way, thanks to his adoration of Charles, into the hearts
of them all, and died from old age and perhaps doggy
anxiety a few months after Charles had sailed for France.
In her father’s study, a small room heterogeneously
adorned with hunting crops and car accessories and
stuffed trout and a large scale map of Medlow and neighbourhood
and suggestive in no way of a studious habit,
the surface of the knee-hole writing table and the mahogany
mantelpiece were scored with fluted little burns
from cigarette-ends, he having been a careless smoker.
There was a legend that the family cradle, for many
years mouldering in an outhouse, bore the same stigmata.
The very bathroom was not free of intimate history. In
the midst of the blue and red stained panes on the lower
sash stared one of plain ground glass—the record of her
brother Bobby aged twelve, who, vowing vengeance
against an unsympathetic visiting aunt (soon afterwards
deceased), had the brilliant idea of catapulting her
through the closed window while she was having her
bath. And there was her mother’s room.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not let all this pass into vulgar hands. The
vague plan of letting the house furnished, which had
hitherto not been unattractive, now became monstrously
definite. She hated the sacrilegious and intrusive Major
Olifant. He would bring down a dowdy wife and a cartload
of children to the profanation of these her household
gods. She went in search of Myra and found her dusting
her own prim little bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going out. When Major Olifant calls, tell him
I’ve changed my mind and the house is not to let.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she put on hat and coat and went downstairs to
take the air of the sleepy midday High Street. But as
she opened the front door she ran into a man getting
out of a two-seater car driven by a chauffeur. He
raised his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” said he, “but is this ‘The
Towers’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” she replied. “I suppose you’ve—you’ve come
with an order to view from Messrs. Trivett and Gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so,” said he pleasantly. “I have an appointment
with Miss Gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Miss Gale,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She noticed an involuntary twitch of surprise, at once
suppressed, pass over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my name’s Olifant. Major Olifant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had pictured quite a different would-be intruder, a
red-faced, obese, and pushing fellow. Instead, she saw
a well-bred, spare man of medium height wearing a
stained service Burberry the empty left sleeve of which
was pinned in front; a man in his middle thirties, with
crisp light brown hair, long, broad forehead characterized
by curious bumps over the brows, a very long, straight
nose and attractive dark blue eyes which keenly and
smilingly held hers without touch of offence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve decided not to let the house,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smile vanished from his eyes. “I’m sorry,” said
he stiffly. “I was given to understand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,” she said quickly. Her conscience
getting hold of the missing arm smote her. “Where have
you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oxford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gasped. “Why, that’s a hundred miles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ninety-four.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must be perishing with cold,” she cried. “Do
come in and get warm, at any rate. Perhaps I can explain.
And your man, too.” She pointed. “Round
that way you’ll find a garage. I’ll send the maid. Please
come in, Major Olifant. Oh—but you must!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She entered the house, leaving him no option but to
follow. To divest himself of his Burberry he made
curious writhing movements with his shoulders, and
swerved aside politely when she offered assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t worry. I’m all right. I’ve all kinds of
little stunts of my own invention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as he said it, he got clear and threw the mackintosh
on the oak chest. He rubbed the knuckle of his
right hand against the side of his rough tweed jacket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just five minutes to get warm and I won’t trespass
further on your hospitality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She showed him into the drawing-room, thanked goodness
there was a showy wood-fire burning, and went out
after Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought the house wasn’t to be let,” said the latter
after receiving many instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The letting of the house has nothing to do with two
cold and hungry men who have motored here on a raw
November morning for hundreds of miles on false pretences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She re-entered the drawing-room with a tray bearing
whisky decanter, siphon, and glass, which she set on a
side table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m alone in the world now, Major Olifant,” she said,
“but I’ve lived nearly all my life with men—my father
and two brothers——” She felt that the explanation
was essential. “Please help yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met her eyes, which, though defiant, held the menace
of tears. He made the vaguest, most delicate of gestures
with his right hand—his empty sleeve, the air. She
moved an assenting head; then swiftly she grasped the
decanter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say when.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She squirted the siphon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfect. A thousand thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the glass from her and deferentially awaited
her next movement. Tricksy memory flashed across her
mind the picture of the Anglo-Indian colonel of her
mother’s pathetic little confidence. For a moment or two
she stood confused, flushed, self-conscious, suddenly hating
herself for not knowing instinctly what to do. In
desperation she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please drink it! You must want it awfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, made a little bow, and drank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now do sit down near the fire. I’m dreadfully
sorry,” she continued when they were settled. “Dreadfully
sorry you should have had all this journey for nothing.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to let the house and
only changed my mind an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have lived here all your life?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please say no more about it,” said he courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She burst at once into explanations. Father, brothers,
mother—all the dear ghosts, at the last moment, had held
out their barring hands. He smiled at her pretty dark-eyed
earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are few houses nowadays without ghosts. But
there might be a stranger now and then who would have
the tact and understanding to win their confidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was at the end of a talk which had lasted she
knew not how long. The little silence which ensued was
broken by the shrill clang of the ormolu clock on the
mantelpiece striking one. She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One o’clock. Why, you must be famished. Seven
o’clock breakfast at latest. There’ll be something to eat,
whatever it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear Miss Gale,” cried Major Olifant, rising
in protest, “I couldn’t dream of it—there must be an
hotel——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t,” cried Olivia unveraciously, and vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Olifant, too late to open the door for her, retraced
his steps and stood, back to fire, idly evoking, as a
man does, the human purposes that had gone to the making
of the room, and he was puzzled. Some delicate
spirit had chosen the old gold curtains which harmonized
with the cushions on the plain upholstered settee and with
the early Chippendale armchairs and with the Chippendale
bookcase filled with odds and ends of good china,
old Chelsea, Coalport, a bit or two of Sèvres and Dresden.
Some green chrysanthemums bowed, in dainty raggedness,
over the edge of a fine cut crystal vase. An exquisite
water-colour over the piano attracted his attention.
He crossed the room to examine it and drew a
little breath of surprise to read the signature of Bonington—a
thing beyond price. On a table by the French
window, which led into a conservatory and thence into
the little garden, stood a box of Persian lacquer. But
there, throwing into confusion the charm of all this, a great
Victorian mirror in a heavy florid gold frame blared like
a German band from over the mantelpiece, and on the
opposite wall two huge companion pictures representing
in violent colours scenes of smug domestic life, also in
gold frames, with a slip of wood let in bearing the legend
“Exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1888,” screamed like
an orchestrion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was looking round for further evidence of obvious
conflict of individualities, when Myra appeared to take
him to get rid of the dust of the journey. When he returned
to the drawing-room he found Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help feeling an inconscionable intruder,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My only concern is that I’ll be able to give you
something fit to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “The man who has come out of France
and Mesopotamia finikin in his food is a fraud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still,” she objected, “I don’t want to send you back
to Mrs. Olifant racked with indigestion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Olifant?” He wore a look of humorous
puzzlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you have a wife and family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens, no!” he cried, with an air of horror.
“I’m a bachelor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She regarded him for a few seconds, as though from
an entirely fresh point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what on earth does a bachelor want with a great
big house—with ten bedrooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has it got ten bedrooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presume Mr. Trivett sent you the particulars:
‘Desirable Residence, standing in own grounds, three
acres. Ten bedrooms, three reception rooms. Bath H.
and C.,’ and so forth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Bath H. and C. was all I worried about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both laughed. Myra announced luncheon. They
went into the dining-room. By the side of Major Olifant’s
plate was a leather case. He flashed on her a look
of enquiry, at which the blood rose into her pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been interviewing your man,” she said rather
defiantly. “He produced that from the pocket of the
car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You overwhelm me with your kindness, Miss Gale,”
said he. “I should never have had the courage to ask for
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case contained the one-armed man’s patent combination
knife and fork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage is such a funny thing,” said Olivia. “A
man will walk up to a machine-gun in action and knock
the gunner out with the butt end of a rifle; but if he’s
sitting in a draught in a woman’s drawing-room and
catching his death of cold, he daren’t get up and shut
the window. These are real eggs, although they’re
camouflaged in a Chinese scramble. One faithful hen
is still doing her one minute day. The others are on
strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt curiously exhilarated on this first actual occasion
of asserting her independence. Only once before
had she entertained guests at her own table, and these
were her uncle and aunt from Clapham, the Edward
Gales, who came to her mother’s funeral. They were
colourless suburban folk who were pained by her polite
rejection of their proposal to make her home with them
on a paying footing, and reproached her for extravagance
in giving them butter (of which, nevertheless, they ate
greedily) instead of margarine. Her uncle was a pallid
pharmaceutical chemist and lived above the shop, and
his wife, a thin-lipped, negative blonde, had few interests
in life outside the Nonconformist Communion into which
she had dragged him. Olivia had seen them only once
before, also at a funeral, that of a younger brother who
had died at the age of three. Her robustious country-loving,
horse-loving, dog-loving, pig-loving father had
never got on with his bloodless brother. A staunch supporter
of the Church of England to the extent of renting
a pew in the Parish Church in which, in spite of the
best intentions, he had never found time to sit, he confessedly
hated dissent and all its works, especially those
undertaken by Mrs. Edward. His vice of generosity
did not accord with their parsimonious virtues. Once,
Olivia remembered, he had dined with them at Clapham
and returned complaining of starvation. “One kidney between
the three of us,” he declared. “And they gave
me the middle gristly bit!” So Olivia felt no call of the
blood to Clapham. And, for all her inherited hospitable
impulses, she had been glad when, having critically picked
the funeral baked meats to the last bone, they had gone
off in sorrow over her wicked prodigality and lack of
true Christian feeling. But for their dreary and passing
shadows she had eaten alone—she caught her breath to
think of it—ever since her father’s last leave—shortly
before he died at Etaples—eighteen months ago. Her
hostess-ship at the present moment was a bubbling joy.
Only her sense of values restrained her from ordering up
a bottle of champagne. She contented herself with a
bottle of old Corton—her father had been a judge of
full red wines, burgundy and port, and had stocked a
small but well-selected cellar, and had taught Olivia what
is good that a girl should know concerning them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched her guest’s first sip, as her father had
been wont to watch, and flushed with pleasure when he
paused, as though taken aback, sniffed, sipped again,
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either new conditions are making me take all sorts
of geese for swans, or you’re giving me a remarkable
wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She burst out radiantly: “How lovely of you to spot
it! It’s a Corton, 1887.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But forgive me for saying so,” he remarked. “It’s
not a wine you should spill on any casual tramp. Oh,
of course,” he protested in anticipation. “Your politeness
will assure me that I’m not a casual tramp. But I
am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I owed you something for bringing you on a fool’s
errand. Besides, I wanted to show you what Todger’s
could do when it liked!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Todger’s is wonderful,” he smiled. “And how you
could ever have thought of leaving Todger’s is more than
I can understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m going to leave it, right enough,” she answered.
“What on earth do you think a girl all by herself wants
with a great big house with ten bedrooms, three reception
rooms, bath h. and c., etc., etc.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s your home, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why I don’t like to let it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why go away from it? If it is not an impertinent
question, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met his clear blue eyes and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going out into the world to seek adventure.
There!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” said he, “want to get out of the world and
never have another adventure as long as I live. I’ve had
more than enough for one lifetime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But still,” she retorted, conscious of his bearing and
vigour and other conjectured qualities, “you can’t contemplate
fossilizing here till the end of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’m literally thinking of doing,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt the reaction of bitter disappointment. A man
like him had no right to throw up the sponge. The
sudden blankness of her face betrayed her thoughts. He
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said literally, you know. Fossilizing in the literal
and practical sense. Once upon a time I was a geologist.
I specialized in certain fossils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” gasped Olivia. “I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very fascinating little fossils,” he went on without
reference to her apology, for which Olivia was grateful.
“They’re called foraminifera. Do you know what they
are?” Olivia shook a frankly ignorant head. “They’re
little tiny weeny shells, and the things once inside them
belonged to the protozoa, or first forms of life. They’re
one of the starting-points to the solution of the riddle of
existence. I was dragged away from them to fool about
with other kinds of shells, millions of times bigger and
millions of times less important. I’ve got what I think
are some new ideas about them, and other things connected
with them—it’s a vast subject—and so I’m looking
for a quiet place where I can carry on my work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s awfully interesting,” said Olivia. “But—forgive
me—who pays you for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly mankind two hundred years hence,” he
laughed. “But, if I stick it long enough, they may make
me a Fellow of the Royal Society when I’m—say—seventy-three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you’d tell me some more about these forami—funny
little things I’ve never heard of,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he answered: “No. If once I began, I would
bore you so stiff that you would curse the hour you
allowed me to cross your threshold. There are other
things just as vital as foraminifera. I’ve made my confession,
Miss Gale. Now, won’t you make yours? What
are you keen on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the direct question, Olivia passed in review the aims
and interests and pleasures of her past young life, and
was abashed to find them a row of anæmic little phantoms.
For years her head had been too full of duties.
She regarded him for a moment or two in dismay, then
she laughed in young defiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I’m keen on real live human beings. That’s
my starting-point to the solution of the riddle of existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see who gets there first,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the meal was over, she stood by the door which
he held open for her and hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder whether you would care to look over the
house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should immensely. But—if you’re not going to
let it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be able, at any rate, to tell Mr. Trivett that
he had no business to send you to such an old rabbit
warren,” she replied, with some demureness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m at your orders,” smiled Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She played cicerone with her little business-like air of
dignity, spoke in a learned fashion of water supply, flues,
and boilers. Olifant looked wisely at the kitchen range,
while Myra stood at impassive attention and the cook
took refuge in the scullery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These holes are to put saucepans on, I presume,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve hit it exactly,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went upstairs. On the threshold of the best
bedroom he paused and cried, in some astonishment:
“What an exquisite room!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my mother’s,” said Olivia. “You can come in.
It has a pleasant view over the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Olifant, who had inspected the study, solved the
puzzle of the drawing-room. There the man and woman
had compromised. She had suffered him to hang his
Victorian mirror and his screaming pictures in the midst
of her delicate scheme. But here her taste reigned absolute.
It was all so simple, so exquisite: a few bits of
Chippendale and Sheraton, a few water-colours on the
walls, a general impression for curtains and upholstery
of faded rose brocade. On a table by the bed-head stood
a little row of books in an inlaid stand. With the instinct
of a bookish man, Olifant bent over to look at their
backs, but first turned to Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.” Then she added, with a vague longing
to impress on a stranger the wonder and beauty of the
spirit that had created these surroundings: “My mother
knew them all by heart, I think. Naturally she used to
read other things and I used to read aloud to her—she
was interested in everything till the day of her death—but
these books were part of her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were: <span class='it'>Marcus Aurelius</span>, <span class='it'>Lord Herbert of Cherbury</span>,
<span class='it'>The Imitation of Christ</span>, <span class='it'>Christina Rossetti</span>, the almost
forgotten early seventeenth century <span class='it'>Arthur Warwick</span>
(“<span class='it'>Spare Minutes; or, Resolved Meditation and Premeditated
Resolutions</span>”), <span class='it'>Crabbe</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a dozen volumes
or so. Olifant picked out one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this, too? The <span class='it'>Pensées de Pascal</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loved it best,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is strange,” said he. “My father spent most of his
life on a monumental work on Pascal. He was a Professor
of Divinity at a Scotch University, but died long
before the monument could be completed. I’ve got his
manuscripts. They’re in an awful mess, and it would
take another lifetime to get them into order. Anyhow, he
took good care that I should remember Pascal as long
as I lived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had me christened Blaise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blaise Olifant,” she repeated critically. She laughed.
“He might have done worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned over the pages. “There’s one thing here
that my father was always drumming into me. Yes, here
it is. It’s marked in blue pencil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it must have been drummed into me, too,” said
Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>On ne consulte que l’oreille, parce qu’on manque de
cœur. La règle est l’honnêteté.</span>´”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He replaced the book. They went in silence out to the
landing. After a few seconds of embarrassment they
turned and descended to the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can more than understand, Miss Gale, why you feel
you can’t let the house. But I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She weakened, foreseeing the house empty and desolate,
given over to dust and mice and ghosts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the idea of a pack of people, the British Family
in all its self-centredness and selfishness, coming in here
that I couldn’t stand,” she confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then is there a chance for me?” he asked, his face
brightening. “Look. I’m open to a bargain. The
house is just what I want. I’m not a recluse. I’m quite
human. I should like to have a place where I can put
up a man or so for a week-end, and I’ve a married sister,
none too happy, who now and then might like to find
a refuge with me. There’s also a friend, rather a distinguished
fellow, who wants to join me for a few months’
quiet and hard work. So, suppose I give you my promise
to hold that room sacred, to keep it just as it is and allow
no one to go into it except a servant to dust and so forth—what
would you say? Not now. Think it over and
write to me at your convenience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sympathy and comprehension had won her over.
He was big and kind and brotherly. Somehow she felt
that her mother would have liked him, accepting him
without question as one of her own caste, and would
have smiled on him as High Priest in charge of the
Household Gods. She reflected for a while, then, meeting
his eyes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can have the house, Major Olifant,” she said
seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed. “I’m sure you will not regret it,” said he.
“I ought to remind you, however,” he added after a pause,
“that I may have a stable companion for a few months.
The distinguished fellow I mentioned. I wonder whether
you’ve heard of Alexis Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who wrote <span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you read it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I have,” cried Olivia. “What do you think
I do here all day? Twiddle my thumbs or tell my fortune
by cards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you think it’s a great book,” he said, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An amazing book. And you’re going to bring him to
live here? What’s he like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would take days to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, compress it into a sort of emergency ration,”
said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he sat by her side on the oak settle, near the anthracite
stove in the hall, and told her what he knew of
Alexis Triona.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span><span class='sc'>HAT</span> Blaise Olifant told Olivia about his
prospective co-inhabitant of The Towers,
and what Rowington, the publisher, and one
or two others knew about him, amounted to the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning a motor-car, having the second-hand air
of a hiring garage and unoccupied save for the chauffeur,
drew up before the door of a great London publishing
house. The chauffeur stepped from his seat, collected a
brown-paper package from the interior, and entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I see a member of the firm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk in the enquiry office looked surprised.
Chauffeurs offering manuscripts on behalf of their employers
were plentiful as blackberries in September;
but chauffeurs demanding an interview with the august
heads of the house were rare as blackberries in March.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you can’t do that,” he replied civilly. “If
you leave it here, it will be all right. I’ll give you a receipt
which you can take back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to explain,” said the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scores of people weekly expressed the same desire. It
was the business of the clerk to suppress explanations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a manuscript to be submitted? Well, you must
tell the author——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the author,” said the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said the clerk, and his subconscious hand
pushed the manuscript a millimetre forward on the polished
mahogany counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The circumstances, you see, are exceptional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There being something exceptional in the voice and
manner of the chauffeur, the clerk regarded him for the
first time as a human being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite see,” said he; “but the rules of the firm are
strict. If you will leave the manuscript, it will be read.
Oh, I give you my word of honour,” he smiled. “Everything
that comes in is read. We have a staff who do nothing
else. Is your name and address on it?” He began
to untie the string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name, but not the address.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the slip of paper which the clerk pushed across to
him he wrote:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Alexis Triona,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;c/o John Briggs.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;3 Cherbury Mews,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Surrey Gardens, W.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The clerk scribbled an acknowledgment, the chauffeur
thrust it into his pocket, and, driving away, was lost in
the traffic of London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fortnight afterwards, Alexis Triona, who, together
with John Briggs, as one single and indissoluble chauffeur,
inhabited a little room over the garage in Cherbury
Mews, received a letter to the effect that the publishing
house, being interested in the MS. “<span class='it'>Through Blood and
Snow</span>,” which he had kindly submitted, would be glad if
he would call, with a view to publication. The result was
a second visit on the part of the chauffeur to the great
firm. The clerk welcomed him with a bland smile,
and showed him into a comfortably furnished room whose
thick Turkey carpet signified the noiseless mystery of
many discreet decades, and where a benevolent middle-aged
man in gold spectacles stood with his back to the
chimney-piece. He advanced with outstretched hand to
meet the author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Triona? I’m glad to meet you. Won’t you sit
down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He motioned to a chair by the tidy writing table, where
he sat and pulled forward the manuscript, which had
been placed there in readiness for the interview. He
said pleasantly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well. Let us get to business at once. We should
like to publish your book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slight quivering of sensitive nostrils alone betrayed
the author’s emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad,” he replied. “I think it’s worth publishing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rowington tapped the MS. in front of him with
his forefinger. “Are these your own personal experiences?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are,” said the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse my questioning you,” said the publisher. “Not
that it would greatly matter. But one likes to know.
We should be inclined to publish it, either as a work of
fiction or a work of fact; but the handling of it—the
method of publicity—would be different. Of course, you
see,” he went on benevolently, “a thing may be absolutely
true in essence, like lots of the brilliant little
war stories that have been written the past few years,
but not true in the actual historical sense. Now, your
book would have more value if we could say that it is
true in this actual historical sense, if we could say that
it’s an authentic record of personal experiences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can say that,” answered Triona quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The publisher leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How a man could have gone through what you have
and remained sane passes understanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time the young man’s set features relaxed
into a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t like to swear that I am sane,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard ex-prisoners say,” Mr. Rowington remarked,
“that six months’ solitary confinement under such
conditions”—he patted the manuscript—“is as much as
the human reason can stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as hunting and killing vermin ceases to be a
passionate interest in life,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They conversed for a while. Stimulated by the publisher’s
question, Triona supplemented details in the book,
described his final adventure, his landing penniless in
London, his search for work. At last, said he, he had
found a situation as chauffeur in the garage of a motor-hiring
company. The publisher glanced at the slip pinned
to the cover of the manuscript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And John Briggs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pseudonym. Briggs was my mother’s name. I am
English on both sides, though my great-grandfather’s
people were Maltese. My father, however, was a naturalized
Russian. I’ve mentioned it in the book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so,” said the publisher. “I only wanted to get
things clear. And now as to terms. Have you any
suggestion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards, Alexis Triona confessed to a wild impulse
to ask for a hundred pounds—outright sale—and to a
sudden lack of audacity which kept him silent. The
terms which the publisher proposed, when the royalty
system and the probabilities of such a book’s profits were
explained to him, made him gasp with wonder. And
when, in consideration, said the publisher, of his present
impecunious position, he was offered an advance in respect
of royalties exceeding the hundred pounds of his
crazy promptings, his heart thumped until it became an
all but intolerable pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think,” he asked, amazed that his work should
have such market value, “that I could earn my living by
writing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly.” The publisher beamed on the new
author. “You have the matter, you have the gift, the
style, the humour, the touch. I’m sure I could place
things for you. Indeed, it would be to our common advantage,
pending publication. Only, of course, you
mustn’t use any of the matter in the book. You quite
understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexis Triona understood. He went away dancing on
air. Write? His brain seethed with ideas. That the
written expression of them should open the gates of Fortune
was a new conception. He had put together the
glowing, vivid book impelled by strange, unknown forces.
It was, as he had confidently declared, worth publishing.
But the possible reward was beyond his dreams. And
he could see more visions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he went back to his garage and drove idle people
to dinners and theatres, and in his scanty leisure wrote
strange romances of love and war in Circassia and Tartary,
and, through the agency of the powerful publishing
house, sold them to solid periodicals, until the public
mind became gradually familiarized with his name. It
was only when the book was published, and, justifying
the confidence of the great firm, blazed into popularity,
that Triona discarded his livery and all that appertained
to the mythical John Briggs and, arraying himself in the
garb of ordinary citizenship, entered—to use, with a
difference, the famous trope of a departed wit—a lion
into the den of London’s Daniels. For, in their hundreds,
they had come to judgment. But knowing very little of
the Imperial Russian Secret Service in Turkestan, or the
ways of the inhabitants of the Ural Mountains, or, at
that time, of Bolshevik horrors in the remote confines of
Asia, they tore each other to pieces, while the lion stepped,
with serene modesty, in the midst of them.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was at Oxford, whither the sudden wave of fame
had drifted him, that he met Blaise Olifant, who was
living in the house of his sister, the wife of a brilliant,
undomesticated and somewhat dissolute professor of political
economy. The Head of a College, interested in
Russia, had asked him down to dine and sleep. There
was a portentous dinner-party whose conglomerate brain
paralyzed the salmon and refroze the imported lamb.
They overwhelmed the guest of honour with their learning.
They all were bent on probing beneath the surface
of his thrilling personal adventures, which he narrated
from time to time with attractive modesty. The episode
of his reprieve when standing naked beside the steaming
chaldron in which he was to be boiled alive caused a
shuddering silence. Perhaps it was too realistic for a
conventional dinner-party, but he had discounted its
ghastliness by a smiling nonchalance, telling it as though
it had been an amusing misadventure of travel. Very
shortly afterwards Mrs. Head of College broke into a
disquisition on the continuity of Russian literature from
Sumakarov to Chekov. Triona, a profound student of
the subject, at last lost interest in the academic socialist
and threw up his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear lady,” said he, “there is a theory in the
United States accounting for the continued sale of <span class='it'>Uncle
Tom’s Cabin</span>. They say immigrants buy it to familiarize
themselves with the negro question. Russian literature
has just as much to do with the Russia of to-day.
It’s as purely archæological as the literature of Ancient
Assyria.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaise Olifant, sitting opposite, sympathized with the
man of actualities set down in this polite academy. Once
he himself had regarded it as the ganglion of the Thought
of the Universe; but having recently seen something of
the said Universe he had modified his view. Why should
these folk not be content with a plain human story of
almost fantastic adventure, instead of worrying the unhappy
Soldier of Fortune with sociological and metaphysical
theories with which he had little time to concern
himself? Why embroil him in a discussion on the
League of Nations’ duty to Lithuania when he was anxious
to give them interesting pictures of Kurdish family
life? He looked round the table somewhat amusedly
at the elderly intellectuals of both sexes, and, forgetting
for a moment the intellectual years of quiet biological
research to which he was about to devote his life, drew
an unflattering contrast between the theorists and their
alien guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He liked the man. He liked the boyish, clean-shaven
face, the broad forehead marked by very thin horizontal
lines, the thin brown hair, parted carelessly at the side,
and left to do what it liked; the dark grey eyes that
sometimes seemed so calm beneath the heavy lids, and
yet were capable of sudden illumination; the pleasant,
humorous mouth, and the grotesque dimple of a hole in the
middle of a long chin. He pitied the man. He pitied
him for the hollows in his temples, for the swift flash
of furtive glances, for the great sinews that stood out in
his lean nervous hands, for the general suggestion of
shrunken muscularity in his figure. A stone, or two,
thought he, below his normal weight. He liked his
voice, its soft foreign intonation; he liked his modesty,
his careless air of the slim young man of no account; he
liked the courteous patience of his manner. He understood
his little nervous trick of plucking at his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the drawing-room after dinner Mrs. Head of College
said to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most interesting man—but I do wish he would
look you in the face when he speaks to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaise Olifant suppressed a sigh. These good people
were hopeless. They knew nothing. They did not even
recognize the unmistakable brand of the prisoner who
has suffered agony of body and degradation of soul. No
man who has been a tortured slave regains, for years,
command of his eyes. Hundreds of such men had Olifant
seen, and the sight of them still made his heart ache.
He explained politely. And with a polite air of unconvinced
assent, the lady received his explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked Triona to lunch the next day, and under the
warmth of his kindly sympathy Triona expanded. He
spoke of his boyhood in Moscow, where his father, a
naturalized Russian, carried on business as a stockbroker;
of his travels in England and France with his English
mother; of his English tutor; of his promising start in
life in a great Russian motor firm—an experience that
guaranteed his livelihood during his late refuge months
in London; of his military service; of his early war days
as a Russian officer; of the twists of circumstance that
sent him into the Imperial Secret Service; of incredible
wanderings to the frontiers of Thibet; of the Revolution;
of the murder of father and mother and the disappearance
of his fortune like a wisp of cloud evaporated by the
sun; of many strange and woeful things related in his
book; of his escape through Russia; of his creeping as a
stowaway into a Swedish timber boat; of his torpedoing
by a German submarine and his rescue by a British destroyer;
of his landing naked save for shirt and trousers,
sans money, sans papers, sans everything of value save
his English speech; of the Russian Society in London’s
benevolent aid; of the burning desire, an irresistible
flame, to set down on paper all that he had gone through;
of the intense nights spent over the book in his tiny ramshackle
room over the garage; and, lastly, of the astounding
luck that had been dealt him by the capricious Wheel
of Fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the presence of a sympathetic audience he threw
aside the previous evening’s cloak of modest impersonality.
He talked with a vivid picturesqueness that held
Olifant spellbound. The furtive look in his eyes disappeared.
They gleamed like compelling stars. His
face lost its ruggedness, transfigured by the born
narrator’s inspiration. Olifant’s sister, Mrs. Woolcombe,
a gentle and unassuming woman on whom the learning of
Oxford had weighed as heavily as the abominable conduct
of her husband, listened with the rapt attention of a
modern Desdemona. She gazed at him open eyed, half
stupefied as she had gazed lately at a great cinematograph
film which had held all London breathless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had gone she turned to her brother, still under
the spell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy’s a magician.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaise Olifant smiled. “The boy’s a man,” said he.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Chance threw them together a while later in London.
There they met frequently, became friends. The quiet
sincerity of the soldier-scholar that was Blaise Olifant
seemed to strike some chord of soothing in the heart of
the young magician. Fundamentally ignorant of every
geological fact, Triona brought to Olifant’s banquet of
fossil solvents of the mystery of existence an insatiable
appetite for knowledge. He listened to reluctant lectures
on elementary phenomena such as ammonites, with the
same rapt attention as Olifant listened to his tales of
the old Empire of Prester John. The Freemasonry of
war, with its common experiences of peril and mutilation—once
Triona slipped off pump and sock and showed a
foot from which three toes had been shot away and an
ankle seared with the fester of fetters—formed a primary
bond of brotherhood. By the Freemasonry of intellect
they found themselves members of a Higher Chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“London is wonderful,” said Triona one day. “London’s
appreciation of the poor thing I have done is enough
to turn anyone’s head. But while my head is being
turned, in the most delightful way in the world, I can’t
find time to do any work. And I must write in order to
live. Do you know a little quiet spot where I could stay
for the winter and write this precious novel of mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaise Olifant reflected for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I myself am looking for a sort of hermitage. In fact,
I’ve heard of one in Shropshire which I’m going to look
at next week. I want a biggish house,” he explained,
with a smile—“I’ve had enough of dug-outs and billets
in a farmhouse with a hole through the roof to last me
my natural life. So there would be room for a guest. If
you would care to come and stay with me, wherever I
pitch my comfortable tent, and carry on your job while
I carry on mine, you would be more than welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow,” cried Triona, impulsively thrusting
out both hands to be shaken, “this is unheard-of generosity.
It means my soul’s salvation. Only the horrible
dread of loneliness—you know the old solitary prisoner’s
dread—has kept me from running down to some little
out-of-the-way place—say in Cornwall. I’ve shrunk
from it. But London is different. In my chauffeur’s
days it was different. I had always associates, fares, the
multitudinous sights and sounds of the vast city. But
solitude in a village! Frankly, I funked it. I’ve lived
so much alone that now I must talk. If I didn’t talk I
should go mad. Or rather I must feel that I can talk if
I want to. I keep hold of myself, however. If I bored
you with my loquacity you wouldn’t have made me your
delightful proposal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ll come, if I can get the right kind of
house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all the gratitude in life,” cried Triona, his eyes
sparkling. “But not as your guest. Some daily, weekly,
monthly arrangement, so that we shall both be free—you
to kick me out—I to go——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you like,” laughed Olifant. “I only should
be pleased to have your company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And God knows,” cried Triona, “what yours would be
to me.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='XXX' id='Page_XXX'></span>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>J</span><span class='sc'>OHN FREKE</span> was one of the most highly respected
men in Medlow. A great leader in municipal
affairs, he had twice been Mayor of the town and
was Chairman of the local hospital, President of clubs
and associations innumerable, and held Provincial
Masonic rank. But as John Freke persisted in walking
about the draper’s shop in Old Street, established by his
grandfather, his family consorted, not with the gentry of
the neighbourhood, but with the “homely folk” such as
the Trivetts and the Gales. His daughter, Lydia, and
Olivia had been friends in the far-off days, although
Lydia was five years older. She was tall and creamy and
massive and capable, and had a rich contralto voice; and
Olivia, very young and eager, had, for a brief period, sat
adoring at her feet. Then Lydia had married a young
officer of Territorials who had been billeted on her father,
and Olivia had seen her no more. As a young war-wife
she pursued all kinds of interesting avocations remote
from Medlow, and, as a young war-widow, had set up a
hat shop in Maddox Street. Rumour had it that she
prospered. The best of relations apparently existed
between herself and old John Freke, who put up the
capital for her venture, and desultory correspondence had
kept her in touch with Olivia. The fine frenzy of girlish
worship had been cured long ago by Lydia’s cruel lack of
confidence during her courtship. The announcement of
the engagement had been a shock; the engagement itself
a revelation of selfish preoccupation. A plain young
sister had been sole bridesmaid at the wedding, and the
only sign of Lydia’s life during the honeymoon had been
a picture postcard on the correspondence space of which
was scrawled “This is a heavenly place. Lydia Dawlish.”
Then had followed the years of sorrow and stress, during
which Olivia’s hurt at the other’s gracelessness had passed,
like a childish thing, away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia’s succeeding letters, mainly of condolence, had,
however, kept unbroken the fragile thread of friendship.
The last, especially, written after Mrs. Gale’s
death, gave evidence of sincere feeling, and emboldened
Olivia, who knew no other mortal soul in London—the
real London, which did not embrace the Clapham aunt
and uncle—to seek her practical advice. In the voluminous
response she recognized the old capable Lydia.
Letter followed letter until, with Mr. Trivett’s professional
assistance, she found herself the lucky tenant of
a little suite in a set of service flats in Victoria Street.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>She entered into possession a fortnight after her interview
with Blaise Olifant, who was to take up residence at
“The Towers” the following day. Mr. Trivett and his
wife, Mr. Fenmarch and Mr. Freke, and the elder Miss
Freke, who kept house for her father, saw her off at the
station, covering her with their protective wings to the
last moment. Each elderly gentleman drew her aside,
and, with wagging of benevolent head, offered help in
time of trouble. They all seemed to think she was making
for disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But their solicitude touched her deeply. The lump
that had arisen in her throat when she had passed out
across the threshold of her old home swelled uncomfortably,
and, when the train moved off and she responded to
waving hands and hats on the platform, tears stood in her
eyes. Presently she recovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should things so dear be so dismal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra, exhibiting no symptoms of exhilaration, did not
reply. As they approached London, Olivia’s spirits rose.
At last the dream of the past weeks was about to be
realized. When she stepped out of the train at Paddington,
it was with the throb of the conqueror setting foot, for
the first time on coveted territory. She devoured with
her eyes, through the taxi windows, the shops and sights
and the movement of the great thoroughfares through
which they passed on their way to Victoria Mansions,
where her fifth-floor eyrie was situated. Once there,
Myra, accustomed to the spacious family house, sniffed
at the exiguous accommodation and sarcastically
remarked that it would have been better if air were laid
on like gas. But Olivia paid little heed to her immediate
surroundings. The cramped flat was but the campaigner’s
tent. Her sphere of action lay limitless beyond
the conventional walls. The walls, however, bounded
the sphere of Myra, who had no conception of glorious
adventure. The rapidly ascending lift had caused
qualms in an unaccustomed stomach, and she felt
uneasy at living at such a height above the ground. Why
Olivia could not have carried on for indefinite years
in the comfort and security of “The Towers” she was
at a loss to imagine. Why give up the ease of a big
house for poky lodgings halfway up to the sky. A
sitting-room, a bedroom, a slip with a bed in it for
herself, a bathroom—Myra thanked goodness both of
them were slim—and that was the London of Olivia’s
promise. She sighed. At last put down Olivia’s aberration
to the war. The war, in those days, explained
everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Olivia had thrown up the sash of the sitting-room
window and was gazing down at the ceaseless
traffic in the street far below—gazing down on the roofs
of the taxis and automobiles which sped like swift
flat beetles, on the dwarfed yet monstrous insects
that were the motor-buses, on the foreshortened
dots of the hurrying ant-like swarms of pedestrians.
It was gathering dusk, and already a few lights
gleamed from the masses of buildings across the
way. Soon the street lamps sprang into successive
points of illumination. She stood fascinated,
watching the rapid change from December day into
December night, until at last the distant road seemed but
a fantastic medley of ever-dying, ever-recurring sounds
and flashes of white and red. Yet it was not fantastic
chaos—her heart leapt at the thought—it was pregnant
with significance. All that rumble and hooting and darting
light proclaimed human purpose and endeavour,
mysterious, breath-catching in its unknown and vast corporate
intensity. Shivers of ecstasy ran through her.
At last she herself was a unit in this eager life of London.
She would have her place in the absorbing yet perplexing
drama into the midst of which she had stepped with no
key to its meaning. But she would pick up the threads,
learn what had gone before—of that she felt certain—and
then—she laughed—she would play her part with
the best of them. To-morrow she would be scurrying
about among them, with her definite human aims. Why
not to-night? Delirious thought! She was free. She
could walk out into the throbbing thoroughfares and who
could say her nay? She put her hand to her bosom and
felt the crackle of ten five-pound notes. To emotional
girlhood the feel of money, money not to hoard and make-do
for weeks and weeks with the spectre of want ever in
attendance, but money to fling recklessly about, has its
barbaric thrill. Suppose she let slip from her fingers one
of the notes and it swayed and fluttered down, down,
down, until at last it reached the pavement, and suppose
a poor starving girl picked it up and carried it home to
her invalid mother.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But, on the other hand, suppose—and
her profound and cynical knowledge of human
chances assured her that it would be a thousand to one
probability—supposing it fell on the silk hat of a corpulent
profiteer! No. She was not going to shower
promiscuous five-pound notes over London. But still
the crackling wad meant power. She was free to go forth
there and then and purchase all the joys, for herself and
others, hovering over there in that luminous haze over
the Westminster towers of the magical city of dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She withdrew from the window and stood in the dark
room, a light in her eyes, and clenched her hands. Yes.
She would go out, now, and walk and walk, and fill her
soul with the wonder of it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then practical memory administered a prosaic jog
to her aspiring spirit. Lydia Dawlish was coming to
dine with her in the common dining-room or restaurant
downstairs. Shivering with cold, she shut the window,
turned on the light and sat by the fire, and ordered tea in
the most matter-of-fact way in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia Dawlish appeared a couple of hours afterwards—fair,
plump, and prosperous, attired in one of her own
dashing creations of hats set at a rakish angle on her
blond hair, and a vast coat of dark fur. Olivia, in her
simple black semi-evening frock run up by an agitated
Medlow dressmaker, felt a poor little dot of a thing
before this regal personage. And when the guest threw
off the coat, the flowered silk lining of which was a dazing
joy to starved feminine eyes, and revealed the slate-blue
dinner gown from which creamy neck and shapely arms
emerged insolent, Olivia could do nothing but stare open-mouthed,
until power came to gasp her wonder and
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only an old thing,” said Lydia. “I had to put on
a compromise between downstairs and Percy’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Percy’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—don’t you know? The night club. I’m going
on afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s face fell. “I thought you were going to spend
the evening with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am, silly child. Night clubs don’t begin
till eleven. A man, Sydney Rooke, is calling for me.
Well. How are you? And what are your plans now
you’ve got here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She radiated health and vigour. Also proclaimed sex
defiant, vaguely disquieting to the country bred girl.
Olivia felt suddenly shy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will take me a few days to turn round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Also to find clothes to turn round in,” said Lydia, with
a good-humoured yet comprehensive glance at the funny
little black frock. “I hope you haven’t been laying in a
stock of things like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia smiled. This was but a makeshift. She had
been saving up for London. Perhaps Lydia would advise
her. She had heard of a good place—what did they call
it?—an enormous shop in Oxford Street. Lydia threw
up her white arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child, you’re not going to be a fashionable
beauty at subscription dances and whist-drives at Upper
Tooting! You’re going to live in London. Good God!
You can’t get clothes in Oxford Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I get them, then?” asked Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the illustrated papers she had become aware of
the existence of Pacotille and Luquin and other mongers
of celestial fripperies; but she had also heard of the Stock
Exchange and the Court of St. James’s and the Stepney
Board of Guardians; and they all seemed equally remote
from her sphere of being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you about with me to-morrow,” Lydia
declared grandly, “and put you in the way of things. I
dare say I can find you a hat or two chez Lydia—that’s
me—at cost price.” She laughed and put a patronizing
arm around Olivia’s shoulders. “We’ll make a woman of
you yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lift carried them down to the restaurant floor.
They dined, not too badly, at a side table from which they
could view the small crowded room. Olivia felt disappointed.
Only a few people were in evening dress. It
was rather a dowdy assembly, very much like that in the
boarding-house at Llandudno, her father’s summer holiday
resort for years before the war. Her inexperience had
expected the glitter and joy of London. Hospitably she
offered wine, champagne, as her father, a lover of celebrations,
would have done; but Lydia drank nothing with
her meals—the only way not to get fat, which she dreaded.
Olivia drank water. The feast seemed tame, and the
imported mutton tough. She reproached herself for
inadequate entertainment of her resplendent friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked; chiefly Lydia, after she had received
Olivia’s report on her family’s welfare and contemporary
Medlow affairs; and Olivia listened contentedly, absorbing
every minute strange esoteric knowledge of the great
London world of which the pulsating centre appeared to
be Lydia, Ltd., in Maddox Street. There Duchesses
bought hats which their Dukes did not pay for. There
Cabinet Ministers’ wives, in the hope of getting on the
right financial side of Lydia, whispered confidential
Cabinet secrets, while Ministers wondered how the
deuce things got into the papers. There romantic engagements
were brought from inception to maturity. There
also, had she chosen to keep a record, she could have
accumulated enough evidence to bring about the divorces
of half the aristocracy of England. She rattled off the
names like a machine-gun. She impressed Olivia with
the fact that Lydia, Ltd., was not a mere hat shop, but a
social institution of which Lydia Dawlish was the creating
and inspiring personality. Lydia, it appeared, weekended
at great houses. “You see, my dear, my husband
was the son of an Honourable and the grandson of an
Earl. He hadn’t much money, poor darling, but still he
had the connection, most useful to me nowadays. The
family buy their hats from me, and spread the glad
tidings.” She commanded a legion of men who had
vowed that she should live, free of charge, on the fat of
the land, and should travel whithersoever she desired in
swift and luxurious motor-cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, my dear,” she said, “it’s rather a strain.
Men will cart about a stylish, good-looking woman for a
certain time, just out of vanity. But if she’s a dull damn
fool, they’re either bored to tears and chuck her, or they’ll
want to—well—well—— Anyhow, you’ve got to keep
your wits about you and amuse them. You’ve got to pay
for everything in this life—or work for the
means of paying—which comes to the same thing.
And I work. I don’t say it isn’t pleasant work—but
it’s hard work. You go out with a man
to dinner, theatre and a night club, and dismiss
him at your front door at two o’clock in the morning
with the perfectly contented feeling that he has had
a perfectly good time and would be an ass to spoil things
by hinting at anything different—and you’ve jolly well
earned your comfortable, innocent night’s rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This explosion of the whole philosophy of modern conscientious
woman came at the end of dinner. Olivia toyed
absently with her coffee, watching successive spoonfuls of
tepid light-amber coloured liquid fall into her cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—all these men—” she said in a low voice—the
position was so baffling and so disconcerting. “You are
a beautiful and clever woman. Don’t they sometimes
want to—to make love to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all do. What do you think? I, an unattached
widow and, as you say, not unattractive. But because
I’m clever, I head them off. That’s the whole point of
what I’ve been telling you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, suppose,” replied Olivia, still intent on the
yellowish water, “suppose you fell in love with one of
these men. Women do fall in love, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why then, I’d marry him the next day,” cried Lydia,
with a laugh. “But,” she added, “that’s not the type
of man a sensible woman falls in love with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s eyes sought the tablecloth. She was conscious
of disturbance and, at the same time, virginal resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as my limited experience goes—a woman isn’t
always sensible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has to learn sense. That’s the great advantage
of modern life. It gives her every opportunity of acquiring
it from the moment she goes out into the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what kind of man does the sensible woman fall
in love with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody comfortable,” replied Lydia. “My ideal
would be a young, rather lazy and very broad-minded
bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia shook her head. The only time she had seen
a bishop was at her confirmation. The encounter did
not encourage dreams of romance in episcopal circles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But these men who take you out,” Olivia persisted
thoughtfully “and do all these wonderful things for you—it
must cost them a dreadful lot of money—what kind
of people are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All sorts. Some are of the very best—the backbone
of the nation. They go off and marry nice girls who
don’t frequent night clubs and settle down for the rest
of their lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drank their coffee and went upstairs, where questions
of more immediate practical interest occupied their
minds. Olivia’s wardrobe was passed in review, while
Myra stood impassive like a sergeant at kit inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor child,” said Lydia, “you’ve not a single
article, inside or outside, that is fit to wear. I’ll send
you a second-hand clothes man who’ll buy up the whole
lot as it stands and give you a good price for it. I don’t
know yet quite what you’re thinking of doing—but at
any rate you can’t do it in these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia looked wistfully at the home-made garments
which Lydia cast with scorn across the bed. They, at
least, had seemed quite dainty and appropriate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said, with a sigh, “you know best, Lydia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These all-important matters held their attention till
a quarter past eleven, when Mr. Sydney Rooke was
announced. He was an elderly young man in evening
dress, with crisp black hair parted in the middle and thinning
at the temples. A little military moustache gave
him an air of youth which was belied by deep lines in
his sallow face. His dark eyes were rather tired and his
mouth hard. But his manners were perfect. He gave
them both to understand that though Lydia was, naturally,
the lady of his evening’s devotion yet his heart was
filled with a sense of Olivia’s graciousness. Half a
dozen words and a bow did it. In a polite phrase, a bow
and a gesture he indicated that if Miss Gale would join
them, his cup of happiness would overflow. Olivia
pleaded fatigue. Then another evening? With Mrs.
Dawlish. A pleasant little party, in fact. He would
be enchanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll fix it up for about a fortnight hence,” said
Lydia significantly. “To-morrow, then, dear, at eleven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had gone Olivia, who had accompanied
them to the flat door, threw herself on the sofa and, putting
her hands behind her head stared over the edge of
her own world into a new one, strange and bewildering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ever going to bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I must,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are dressed-up men like that often coming here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows,” said Olivia, “who are coming here. I
don’t.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> Odyssey or the Argonautic, or whatever you
like to call the epic of the first wild adventure
of a young woman into the Infinite of Clothes,
has yet to be written. It would need not only a poet,
but a master of psychology, to record the myriad vibrations
of the soul as it reacts to temptations, yieldings,
tremulous thrills of the flesh, exquisite apprehensions,
fluttering joys, and each last voluptuous plenitude of
content. It is an adventure which absorbs every faculty
of the will; which ignores hunger and thirst, weariness
of limb and ache of head; which makes the day a dream
of reality and the night the reality of a dream. Hardened
women of the world with frock-worn minds are
caught at times by the lure of the adventure, even when
it is a question of a dress or two and a poor half a dozen
hats. But how manifold more potent the spell in the
case of one who starts with her young body in Nymph-like
innocence and is called upon to clothe it again and
again in infinite variety, from toe to head, from innermost
secret daintiness to outward splendour of bravery!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a record would explain Olivia, not only to the
world, but to herself during that first fortnight in London.
Her hours could be reckoned by gasps of wonder.
She lost count of time, of money, of human values.
Things that had never before entered into her philosophy,
such as the subtle shade of silk stockings which would
make or mar a costume, loomed paramount in importance.
The after-use scarcely occurred to her. Sufficient
for the day was the chiffon thereof; also the gradual
transformation of herself from the prim slip of a girl
with just the pretension (in her own mind) to good looks,
into a radiant and somewhat distinguished dark-haired
little personage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her shrinkings, her arguments with Lydia Dawlish,
her defeats, went all into the melting-pot of her delight.
“No bath salts, my dear?” cried Lydia. “Whoever
heard of a woman not using bath salts?” So bath salts
were ordered. And—horrified: “My dear, you don’t
mean to say you wash your face in soap and water.
What will become of your skin?” So Olivia was put
under the orders of a West End specialist, who stocked
her dressing-table with delectable creams and oils. It
was all so new, so unheard of, so wonderful to the girl,
an experience worth the living through, even though all
thousands at deposit at the bank should vanish at the
end of it. Merely to sit in a sensuously furnished room
and have beautiful women parade before her, clad in
dreams of loveliness—any one of which was hers for a
scribble on a bit of pink paper—evoked within her
strange and almost spiritual emotions. Medlow was
countless leagues away; this transcended the London
even of her most foolish visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards Olivia, when, sense of values being restored
she looked back on this phantasmagoria of dressmakers,
milliners, lingerie makers and furriers, said to Lydia
Dawlish:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s funny, but the fact that there might be a man
or so in the world never entered my head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the wise Lydia answered: “You were too busy
turning yourself into a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice or thrice during this chrysalis period she stole
out of nights with Myra to the dress circle of a theatre,
where, besides ingenuous joy in the drama, she found
unconfessed consolation in the company of homely folk
like herself—girls in clean blouses or simple little frocks
like her own, and young men either in well-worn khaki
or morning dress. On these occasions she wondered
very much what she was about to do in the other galley—that
of the expensively furred and jewelled haughtinesses
and impudences whom she shouldered in the vestibule
crush and whom she saw drive away in luxurious
limousines. These flashing personalities frightened her
with their implied suggestions of worlds beyond her ken.
One woman made especial impression on her—a woman
tall, serene, with a clear-cut face, vaguely familiar, and
a beautiful voice; she overheard a commonplace phrase
or two addressed to the escorting man. She brushed
Olivia’s arm and turned with a smile and a word of gracious
apology and passed on. Olivia caught a whisper
behind her. “That’s the Marchioness of Aintree. Isn’t
she lovely?” But she did not need to be told that she
had been in contact with a great lady. And she went
home doubting exceedingly whether, for all her flourish of
social trumpets, Lydia Dawlish’s galley was that of Lady
Aintree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Criticism of Lydia, however, she put behind her as
ingratitude, for Lydia made up royally for past negligence.
Time and energy that ought to have been devoted
to Lydia, Ltd., was diverted to the creation of
Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why you’re so good to me,” she would
say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the other, with a little mocking smile round her
lips: “It’s worth it. I’m giving myself a new experience.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The first occasion on which she went out into the great
world was that of Sydney Rooke’s party. She knew that
her low-cut, sleeveless, short-skirted gown of old gold
tissue had material existence, but she felt herself half-ashamedly,
half-deliciously clad in nothing but a bodily
sensation. A faint blush lingered in her cheeks all the
evening. Lydia, calling for her in Rooke’s car, which
had been placed at her disposal, held her at arm’s length
in sincere and noble admiration, moved by the artist’s
joy in beholding the finished product of his toil, and
embraced her fondly. Then she surveyed her again,
from the little gold brocade slippers to the diamond
butterfly (one of her mother’s bits of jewellery) in her
dark wavy hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the daintiest elf in London,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the dinner at the Savoy Sydney Rooke had invited
a white-moustached soldier, Major-General Wigram,
whose blue undress uniform, to the bedazzlement of
Olivia, gleamed with four long rows of multi-coloured
ribbon; a vivacious middle-aged woman, Mrs. Fane Sylvester,
who wrote novels, plays, books of travel, and
fashion articles in a weekly periodical—Olivia learned
all this in their first five-minute converse in the lounge;
Sir Paul and Lady Barraclough, he a young baronet
whose civilian evening dress could not proclaim hard-won
distinctions, she a pretty, fair, fragile creature, both
of them obviously reacting joyously to relaxation of tension;
and, last, the Vicomte de Mauregard, of the French
Embassy, young, good looking, who spoke polished English
with a faultless accent. It was, socially, as correct
a little party as the brooding, innocent spirit of Mrs.
Gale could have desired for her about-to-be prodigal
daughter. Olivia sat between her host and Mauregard.
On her host’s right was Lady Barraclough; then the
General, then Lydia, then Sir Paul, facing Rooke at the
round table, then Mrs. Fane Sylvester, who was Mauregard’s
left-hand neighbour. They were by the terrace
windows, far from what Olivia, with her fresh mind playing
on social phenomena, held then and ever afterwards,
most rightly, to be the maddening and human intercourse-destroying
band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that her first entrance down the imposing broad
staircase, into the lounge filled with mirifically vestured
fellow-creatures, to the accompaniment of a clashing rag-time
imbecility, did not set all her young nerves vibrating
to the point of delicious agony. It was like a mad
fanfare heralding her advent in a new world. But soon
she found that the blare of the idiot music deadened all
other senses. Before her eyes swayed black-and-white
things whom at the back of her mind she recognized as
men, and various forms all stark flesh, flashing jewels
and a maze of colours, whom she knew to be women.
The gathering group of her own party seemed but figures
of a dream. Her unaccustomed ears could not catch a
word of the conventional gambits of conversation opened,
on introduction, by her fellow guests. It was only when
they passed between the tables of the great restaurant
and the horrible noise of the negroid, syncopated parody
of tune grew fainter and fainter, and they reached the
peace of the terrace side, that the maddening clatter
faded from her ears and consciousness of her surroundings
returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she surrendered herself to huge enjoyment.
Both her neighbours had been all over the world and seen
all sorts and conditions of men. They were vividly
aware of current events. Pride would not allow her to
betray the fact that often they spoke of matters far beyond
her experience of men and things. Under their
stimulus she began to regain the self that, for the past
fortnight, the cardboard boxes of London had snowed
under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use asking me,” she said to Mauregard,
“whether I’ve been to Monte Carlo or Madagascar or
Madame Tussaud’s, for I haven’t. I haven’t been anywhere.
I’ve somehow existed at the back of Nowhere,
and to-night I’ve come to life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where did you come from? The sea foam?
Venus Anadyomene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m of the other kind. I come from far inland.
I believe they call it Shropshire. That oughtn’t to convey
anything to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it does!” cried Mauregard. “Was I not at
school at Shrewsbury?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But yes. Three years. So I’m Shropshire, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s delightful,” she remarked; “but it does
away with my little mystery of Nowhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” he protested, with a laugh. He was a fair,
bright-eyed boy with a little curled-up moustache which
gave him the air of a cherub playfully disguised. “It
is the county of mystery. Doesn’t your poet say:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>‘Once in the wind of morning</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I ranged the thymy wold;</p>
<p class='line0'>The world-wide air was azure</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And all the brooks ran gold.’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“That’s from <span class='it'>A Shropshire Lad</span>,” cried Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. So why shouldn’t you have come from
the wind of morning, the azure world-wide air or the
golden brook?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s beautiful of you,” said Olivia. “Well, why
shouldn’t I? It’s more romantic and imaginative than
the commonplace old sea. The sea has been overdone.
I used to look at it once a year, and, now I come to think
of it, it always seemed to be self-conscious, trying to live
up to its reputation. But ‘the wind of the morning——’
Anyhow, here I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blown to London by the wind of a Shropshire morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s spirit danced in the talk. With his national
touch on the lighter emotions, Mauregard drew from her
an exposition of the Dryad’s sensations on sudden confrontation
with modern life. To talk well is a great
gift; to compel others to talk well is a greater; and the
latter gift was Mauregard’s. Olivia put food into her
mouth, but whether it was fish or flesh or fowl she knew
not. When her host broke the spell by an announcement
in her ear that he had a couple of boxes for “Jazz-Jazz,”
she became aware that she was eating partridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sydney Rooke talked of women’s clothes, of which
he had an expert knowledge. Lady Barraclough chimed
in. Olivia, fresh from the welter, spoke as one in authority.
Now and again she caught Lydia’s eye across the
table and received an approving nod. The elderly General
regarded her with amused admiration. She began to
taste the first-fruits of social success. She drove in a taxi
to the theatre with the Barracloughs and Mrs. Fane Sylvester
and sat with them in a box during the first act of
the gay revue. For the second act there was a change
of company and she found herself next to the General.
He had served in India and was familiar with the names
of her mother’s people. What Anglo-Indian was not?
Long ago he had met an uncle of hers; dead, poor chap.
This social placing gave her a throb of pleasure, setting
her, at least, in a stranger’s eyes, in her mother’s sphere.
The performance over, they parted great friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Wigram and Mrs. Fane Sylvester excusing
themselves from going on to Percy’s, the others crowded
into Sydney Rooke’s limousine. The crash of jazz
music welcomed them. Already a few couples were
dancing; others were flocking in from the theatres.
They supped merrily. Sydney Rooke pointed out to
Olivia’s wondering eyes the stars of the theatrical firmament
who condescended to walk the parquet floor of the
famous night club. He also indicated here and there a
perfectly attired youth as a professional dancer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the stage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He explained that they had their professional partners
and gave exhibition dances, showing the new steps.
They also gave private lessons. It was the way they
made their living. Olivia knitted a perplexed brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem a very noble profession for a young
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sydney Rooke shrugged his shoulders politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m with you a thousand times, my dear Miss Gale.
The parasite, <span class='it'>per se</span>, isn’t a noble object. But what
would you have? The noble things of the past few years
came to an end a short while ago, and, if I can read the
times, reaction has already begun. In six months’ time
the noble fellow will be a hopeless anachronism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean,” asked Olivia, “that all the young
men will be rotten?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “How direct you are! Disconcerting, if
I may say so. So positive; while I was approaching the
matter from the negative side. There’ll be a universal
loss of ideals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia protested. “The young man has before him
the reconstruction of the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no,” said Rooke. “He has done his bit. He
expects other people to carry out the reconstructing business
for him. All he cares about is to find a couple of
sixpences to jingle together in his pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have these young men who devote their lives to
foxtrotting done their bit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He begged the question. “Pray be guided by my prophecy,
Miss Gale. Next year you mustn’t mention war
to ears polite. These young men are alive. They thank
God for it. Let you and me do likewise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little supper-table talk was the only cloud on a
radiant night. The Vicomte de Mauregard took her to
dance. At first she felt awkward, knowing only the
simple steps of five years ago. But instinct soon guided
her, and for two hours she danced and danced in an unthinking
ecstasy. The clattering and unmeaning din
which had dazed her on her entrance to the Savoy was
now pregnant with physical significance. The tearing
of the strings, the clashing of the cymbals, the barbaric
thumping of the drum, the sudden raucous scream from
negro throats, set vibrating within her responsive chords
of an atavistic savagery. When each nerve-tearing cacophony
came to its abrupt end, she joined breathlessly
with the suddenly halting crow in eager clapping for the
encore. And then, when the blood-stirring strings and
cymbals crashed out, overpowering the staccato of hand
beating hand, she surrendered herself with an indrawn
sigh of content to her partner’s arm—to the rhythm, to
the movement, to the mere bodily guidance, half conscious
of the proud flexibility of her frame under the man’s firm
clasp, to something, she knew not what, far remote from
previous experience. Strange, too, the personality of the
man did not matter. Paul Barraclough, Sydney Rooke,
Mauregard, she danced with them all in turn. In her
pulsating happiness she mixed them all up together, so
that a flashing glance, liable to be misinterpreted, proceeded
from a mere impulse of identification. Now and
then, in the swimming throng of men and women, and the
intoxication of passing raiment impregnated with scent
and cigarette smoke, she exchanged an absent smile with
Lydia and Lady Barraclough. Otherwise she scarcely
realized their existence. She was led panting by Mauregard
to a supper table while he went in search of refreshment.
He returned with a waiter, apologizing for the
abomination of iced ginger ale and curled orange peel,
which was all that the laws of the land allowed him to
offer. Horse’s neck, it was called. She laughed, delighted
with the name, and, after drinking, laughed again,
delighted with the cool liquid so tingling on her palate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a drink for the gods,” she declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you offered it, the unfortunate Bacchus would
drink it without a murmur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really think it’s so awful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon Dieu!</span>” replied the young Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Lydia came up with a dark-eyed, good-looking
boy in tow, whom she introduced, as Mr. Bobbie Quinton
and Olivia was surprised to recognize as one of the
professionals. She accepted, however, his invitation to
dance and went off on his arm. She found him a boy
of charming manners and agreeable voice, and in the
lightness and certainty of his dancing he far outclassed
her other partners. He suggested new steps. She tried
and blundered. She excused herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the first time I’ve danced for four years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter,” said he. “You’re a born dancer.
You only need a few lessons to bring you up to date.
What I find in so many of the women I teach is that they
not only don’t begin to understand what they’re trying
to do, but that they never try to understand. You, on
the other hand, have it instinctively. But, of course, you
can’t learn steps in a place like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you could give me some lessons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all the pleasure in life, Miss Gale,” replied Mr.
Bobbie Quinton promptly.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>About two o’clock in the morning Sydney Rooke and
Lydia deposited Olivia at the front door of Victoria
Mansions. Rooke stood hat in hand as she entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’ve not been too bored by our little evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bored! It has been just one heaven after another
opening out before me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not the seventh. If only I could have provided
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find it in the happiest and soundest night’s rest I
ever had,” said Olivia.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HIS</span> was life; magical, undreamed of in her wildest
Medlow dreams. And thanks to Lydia, she
had plunged into it headlong, after a mere fortnight’s
probation. There had been no disillusion. She
had plunged and emerged into her kingdom. London
conspired to strew her path with roses. The Barracloughs
invited her to a dinner party at their home in
Kensington. General Wigram offered her dinner and
theatre and convened to meet her an old Indian crony,
General Philimore, and his young daughter, Janet. Philimore
had known her grandfather, Bagshawe of the
Guides, when he was a subaltern, infinite ages ago. The
world was a small place, after all. Olivia, caring little
for grandfathers beyond their posthumous social guarantee,
found youth’s real sympathy in Janet, who held
open for her their flat in Maida Vale. Young Mauregard,
after their first lunch together at the Carlton,
seemed prepared to provide her with free meals and
amusements for the rest of time. It is true he was madly
in love with a Russian dancer, whose eccentric ways
and abominable treatment of him formed the staple of
the conversation which he poured into her very interested
and compassionate ear. And, last, Bobbie Quinton gave
her dancing lessons at the flat at the rate of a guinea
apiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas caused a break in these social activities.
Lydia took her off to Brighton, where, meeting various
acquaintances of her chaperone and making others of
her own, she motored and danced and danced and motored,
and in the pursuit of these delights discovered,
with a fearful joy, that she could hold her own in the
immemorial conflict of sex. Sydney Rooke, having
driven down for the day, occasionally flashed through
the hotel, the eternal smile of youth on his dark, lined
face and his gestures unceasingly polite. As he passed,
the heavens opened and rained champagne and boxes
of chocolate and hot-house fruits and flowers and
embroidered handbags, and once, a Pekinese dog for
Lydia. Once again, an automobile seemed about to
fall, but at Lydia’s protests it melted in the ether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dog and a rose and a glass of wine,” said she, “are
a woman’s due for amusing a man. But a motor-car
is profiteering. Besides, it’s bound to drive you somewhere
in the end—either to the flat of shame or the
country house of married respectability: it only depends
on who is at the wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Olivia. But she didn’t. Sydney Rooke
was a mystery; and Lydia’s attitude towards him was
more than her inexperience could understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, there she was in the pleasant galley and she did
not question what she was doing in it. In a dim way she
regarded it as the inevitable rescue vessel after universal
shipwreck. Her eyes were blinded by its glitter and her
ears deafened by its music to the welter of the unsalved
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before New Year she received a letter from Bobby
Quinton. It began: “Dearest of Ladies.” Never before
having been thus apostrophized, she thought it peculiarly
graceful and original. The writing was refined and
exquisitely clear. To his dearest of ladies the young man
bewailed her absence; life was dreary without her
friendship and encouragement; all this Christmastide he
was the loneliest thing on earth; he suggested that there
was no one to love him—no mother or sisters to whom he
could apply for comfort; this terrible night life to which
he, poor demobilized soldier of fortune, was condemned
in order to earn his bread, weighed upon his spirits and
affected his health; he envied his dearest of ladies’ sojourn
by the invigorating sea; he longed for the taste of
it; but such health-restoring rapture he gave her, in the
most delicate way, to understand, was for fairy princesses
and not for the impecunious demobbed; he counted
the days till her return and prayed her to bring back
a whiff of ozone on her garments to revive the ever faithful
one who had the temerity to try to teach her to dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A most piteous epistle. Bobby Quinton, by his ingratiating
ways and his deference and his wit, had effaced
her original conception of the type of young men who
danced at night clubs for their living. She liked him.
He seemed so young and she, through her long companionship
with sorrow, so old in comparison; he seemed so
foolish and impossible, and she so wise; to her, remembering
the helpless dependence of her father and brothers,
he seemed (motherless and sisterless as he was) lost in
a hostile world. Besides, he was not a nameless adventurer.
His father (long since deceased) had been a
Colonial Governor. He had been to one of the great
public schools. In short, he had the birth and breeding
of a gentleman. She slipped on a dressing-gown and went
with the letter to Lydia, full of maternal purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nine o’clock in the morning. Their rooms had
a communicating door. She found Lydia daintily attired
in boudoir cap and dressing-jacket, having breakfast in
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor boy’s dying for a breath of sea air. It
would do him an enormous amount of good. Do you
think we—of course, it really would be me—but it would
be better if it appeared to be a joint affair—do you think
we could, without offending him, ask him to come down
here for a couple of days as our guest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia, who had read the letter with a smile round her
lips, replied drily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as Bobby is concerned—I really think we
could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as far as we are concerned,” flashed Olivia, “why
should the silly fact of being a woman prevent us from
helping a lame dog over a stile?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A he-dog,” said Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it matter?” Olivia asked stoutly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia laughed in her half-cynical, tolerant way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do as you like, dear. I don’t mind. You’re out for
experience, not I. I’d only have you remark that our
he-dog friend Bobby is sitting up and begging for the
invitation——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Ah!” cried Olivia, with a fling of her arm,
“you’re horrid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit,” smiled Lydia. “I face facts, as you’ll
have to do, if you want to find comfort in this matter-of-fact
world. Have your Bobby down by all means.
Only keep your eye on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not my Bobby,” said Olivia indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Bobby, then,” said Lydia, with good-natured indulgence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Olivia, with the little palpitation of the heart attendant
on consciousness of adventurous and (in Medlow
eyes, preposterous) well-doing, wrote to Bobby Quinton
a letter whose gracious delicacy would not have wounded
the susceptibilities of a needy Hidalgo or an impoverished
Highland chieftain, and received in reply a telegram of
eager acceptance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby appeared immaculately vestured, his heart overflowing
with gratitude at the amazing sweetness of his two
dear ladies. Never had man been blessed with such
fairy godmothers. By the fresh frankness of his appreciation
of their hospitality he disarmed criticism.
A younger son hanging on to the court of Louis XIII
never received purses of gold from his lady love with
less embarrassed grace. He devoted himself to their
service. He had the art of tactful effacement, and of appearance
at the exact moment of welcome. He enlivened
their meals with chatter and a boyish brightness
that passed for wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Olivia, the dearest of his dear ladies, he confided
the pathetic history of his life. A sunny, sheltered corner
of the Pier, both sitting side by side well wrapped in furs,
conduced to intimacy. How a young man in such a precarious
financial position could afford to wear a fur-lined
coat with a new astrachan collar it did not strike
Olivia to enquire. That he, like herself, was warm on
that sun-filled morning, with the sea dancing and sparkling
away beyond them, and human types around them exuding
the prosperity of peace, seemed sufficient for the
comfortable hour. He spoke of his early years of ease,
of his modest patrimony coming to an end soon after
the war broke out; of his commission in a yeomanry
regiment; of his heart-break as the months went on and
the chance of the regiment being sent to the front grew
less and less; of his exchange into a regiment of the line;
of the rotten heart that gave out after a month in France;
of his grief at being invalided out of the army and his
struggles and anxieties when he returned to civil life,
branded as physically unfit. He had tried the stage,
musical comedy, male youth in the manless chorus being
eagerly welcomed; then, after a little training, he found
he had the dancer’s gift. “So one thing led to another,”
said he, “and that’s my history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely,” said Olivia, “all this dancing and these
late hours must be very bad for your heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled sadly. “What does it matter? I’m no use
to anybody, and nobody cares whether I’m dead or alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia protested warmly. “The world is crying out for
young men of three-and-twenty. You could be useful
in a million ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a crock like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could go into an office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. In at one door and out of another. Hopeless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew from a slim gold case a Turkish cigarette—Olivia,
minutely hospitable, had put a box of a hundred
in his room—and tapped it thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, which is better—to carry on with life like
a worm—which anyhow perisheth, as the Bible tells us—or
to go out like a butterfly, with a bit of a swagger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you mustn’t talk of going out,” cried Olivia.
“It’s indecent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby lighted his cigarette. “Who would care?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, for one,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her health and sanity revolted against morbid ideas.
He stretched out his hand, and, with the tips of his
fingers, touched her coat, and he bent his dark brown
eyes upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you really?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed, felt angry she scarce knew why, and put
herself swiftly on the defensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would care for the life of any young man. After
a million killed it’s precious—and every decent girl would
care the same as I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re wonderful!” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m common sense incarnate,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are. You’re right. You’re right a thousand
times,” he replied. “I’ll always remember what you have
said to me this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At his surrender she disarmed. A corpulent, opulent
couple passed them by, the lady wearing a cheap feathered
hat and a rope of pearls outside a Kolinsky coat, the
gentleman displaying on an ungloved right hand, which
maintained in his mouth a gigantic cigar, an enormous
ruby set in a garden border of diamonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate,” said Bobby, “I’m not as some other men
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they laughed and discussed the profiteers and walked
back to the hotel for lunch with the sharpened appetites
of twenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Bobby Quinton left them, Olivia reproached
herself for lack of sympathy. The boy had done his
best. A rotten, and crocky heart, who was she to despise?
But for circumstance he might have done heroic
things. Perhaps in his defiance of physical disability he
was doing a heroic thing even now. Still.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To Lydia,
in an ironically teasing mood, she declared:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I do fall in love, it’s not going to be with any
one like Bobby Quinton. I want a man—there would be
a devil of a row, of course, if he tried—but one capable
of beating me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby would do that, right enough, if you gave him
the chance,” said Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia reflected for a while. “Why have you got your
knife into him like that?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t, my dear child. If I had, do you think I
would have allowed him to come down? I live and let
live. By letting live, I live very comfortably and manage,
with moderate means, to have a very good time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, already dressed for dinner, looked down on the
easy, creamy, handsome, kimono-clad woman, curled up
like a vast Angora cat on the hotel bedroom sofa, and once
more was dimly conscious of a doubt whether the galley
of Lydia Dawlish was the one for her mother’s daughter
to row in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, <span class='it'>vogue la galère</span>. When she returned to London
there was little else to do. Eating and dancing filled
many of her days and nights. She tried to recapture the
pleasure of books which had been all her recreation for
years; but, although her life was not a continuous whirl
of engagements—for it requires a greater vogue as a
pretty and unattached young woman than Olivia possessed
to be booked for fourteen meals and seven evenings
every week of the year—she found little time for
solitary intelligent occupation. If she was at a loose
end, Lydia’s hat shop provided an agreeable pastime. Or,
as a thousand little odds and ends of dress demanded
attention, there was always a sensuous hour or two to
be spent at Pacotille’s and Luquin’s or Deville’s. Tea
companions seldom failed. When she had no evening
engagements she was glad to get to bed, soon after the
dinner in the downstairs restaurant, and to sleep the
sleep of untroubled youth. And all the time the spell of
London still held her captive. To walk the crowded
streets, to join the feminine crush before the plate-glass
windows of great shops, to watch the strange birds in
the ornamental water in St. James’s Park, to wander
about the Abbey and the Temple Gardens, to enter on
the moment’s impulse a Bond Street picture gallery or a
cinema—all was a matter of young joy and thrill. She
even spent a reckless and rapturous afternoon at Madame
Tussaud’s. Sometimes Janet Philimore accompanied her
on these excursions round the monuments of London.
Janet, who had mild antiquarian tastes and a proletarian
knowledge of London traffic, took her by tubes and buses
to the old City churches and the Tower, and exhibited
to her wondering gaze the Bank of England and the
Royal Exchange and Guildhall up the narrow street. For
sentimental interest, there was always Bobby Quinton,
who continued to maintain himself under her maternal
eye. And so the new life went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one night in April, while she was standing under
the porch of a theatre, Mouregard, her escort, having
gone in search of his dinner-and-theatre brougham—for
those were days when taxis were scarce and drivers
haughty—that she found herself addressed by a long-nosed,
one-armed man, who raised his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Gale—I’m sure you don’t remember me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a second or two she could not place him. Then she
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—Major Olifant!” She shook hands. “What
are you doing here? I thought you were buried among
your fossils. Do tell me—how are the hot-water pipes?
And how is the parrot? Myra has no faith in your
bachelor housekeeping and is sure you’ve eaten him out
of desperation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned a light answer. Then, touching the arm
of a man standing by his side:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Gale—can I introduce Mr. Alexis Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona bowed, stood uncovered while he took the hand
which Olivia held out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my landlady,” said Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is privileged beyond the common run of mortals,”
said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very pretty,” laughed Olivia, with a swift,
enveloping glance at the slight, inconspicuous youth who
had done such wonderful things. “I’ve not thought of
myself as a landlady before. I hope I don’t look like
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Visions of myriad Bloomsbury lodging-houses at whose
doors he had knocked after he had left the tiny room in
Cherbury Mews, and of the strange middle-aged women
of faded gentility whom he had interviewed within
those doors, rose before Triona’s eyes, and he laughed too.
For under the strong electric light of the portico, unkind
to most of the other waiting women, showing up lines and
hollows and artificialities of complexion, she looked as
fresh and young as a child on a May morning. The
open theatre wrap revealed her slender girlish figure,
sketchily clad in a flame-coloured garment; and, with the
light in her eyes and her little dark head proudly poised,
she stood before the man’s fancy as the flame of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you in town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a few days. Getting rid of cobwebs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d lend you quite a nice broom, if you could find
time to come and see me. Besides, I do want to hear
about my beloved Polly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be delighted,” said Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They arranged that he should come to tea at the flat
the following day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if so famous a person as Mr. Triona would
honour me, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare I?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s on the fifth floor, but there’s a lift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw Mauregard hurrying up. With a “Four-thirty,
then,” and a smile of adieu, she turned and joined
Mauregard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go on to Percy’s?” asked the young Frenchman,
standing at the door of the brougham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia conceived a sudden distaste for Percy’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless you particularly want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Good Lord!” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you ever go, if it bores you like that?” she
asked as the brougham started Victoria-wards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ce que femme veut, Mauregard le veut.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that is why you’ve never made love to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” he asked, surprised out of his perfect English
idiom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve wanted you not to make love to me, and you
haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could I make love to you, when I have been
persecuting you with the confessions of my unhappy love
affairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One can always find a means,” said Olivia. “That’s
why I like you. You are such a good friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” said he. Then, after a short silence:
“Let me be frank. What is going on at the back of
your clever English mind is perfectly accurate. I am
tempted to make love to you every time I see you. What
man, with a man’s blood in his veins, wouldn’t be tempted,
no matter how much he loved another woman? But I
say to myself: ‘Lucien, you are French to the marrow
of your bones. It is the nature of that marrow not to
offend a beautiful woman by not making love to her.
But, on the other hand, the Lady Olivia whose finger-tips
I am unworthy to kiss’—he touched them with his
lips, however, in the most charming manner—‘is English
to the marrow of <span class='it'>her</span> bones, and it is the nature of that
marrow to be offended if a man makes obviously idle
love to her.’ So, not wishing to lose my Lady Olivia,
whose friendship and sympathy I value so highly, I accept
with a grateful heart a position which would be
incomprehensible to the vast majority of my fellow-countrymen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad we’ve had this out,” said Olivia after a
pause. “I’ve been a bit worried. A girl on her own has
got to take care of herself, you know. And you’ve been
so beautifully kind to me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because I am proud to call myself your humble
and devoted servant,” replied Mauregard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia went to bed contented with this frank explanation.
Men had already made love to her in a manner
which had ruffled her serene consciousness, and she
found it, not like Lydia Dawlish, a cynical game of wit,
but a disagreeable business, to parry their advances.
Bobby Quinton, of course, she could put into a corner
like a naughty child, whenever he became foolish. But
Mauregard, consistently respectful and entertaining, had
been rather a puzzle. Now that way was clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while she did not associate her meeting Blaise
Olifant with her distaste for the night club. In the
flush of her new existence she had almost forgotten him.
There had been no reason to correspond. His rent was
paid through the Trivett and Gale office. His foraminiferous
pursuits did not appeal to a girl’s imagination.
Now and then she gave a passing thought to what was
happening in her old home, and vaguely remembered that
the romantically named traveller was there as a guest.
But that was all. Now, the presence of Olifant had
suddenly recalled the little scene in her mother’s room,
when she had suddenly decided to let him have the
house; he had brought with him a breath of that room;
a swift memory of the delicate water-colours and the books
by the bedside, the <span class='it'>Pensées de Pascal</span> and <span class='it'>The Imitation
of Christ</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides, she had felt a curious attraction
towards the companion, the boy with the foreign
manner and the glistening eyes and the suffering-stricken
face. Both men, as she conceived them, belonged to the
higher intellectual type that had their being remote from
the inanities of dissipation. So, impelled by a muddled
set of motives, she suddenly found herself abhorring
Percy’s. She read herself into a state of chastened self-approbation,
and then to sleep, with Rupert Brooke’s
poems.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span><span class='sc'>LIVIA</span> sat by her little table, dispensing tea and
accepting homage with a flutter of pleasure at
her heart. She had been oddly nervous—she
who had entertained the stranger Olifant, at Medlow,
with the greatest self-confidence, and had grown to regard
tea parties at the flat as commonplaces of existence. The
two men had drifted in from another sphere. She had reviewed
her stock of conversation and found it shop-worn
after five months’ exposure. The most recent of her
views on “Hullo, People!” and on the food at the Carlton
had appeared unworthy of the notice of the soldier-scientist
and the adventurous man of letters. She had
received them with unusual self-consciousness. This,
however, a few moments of intercourse dispelled. They
had come, they had seen and she had conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At first I didn’t recognize you,” said Olifant. “I
had to look twice to make sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I changed so much?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a trick of environment,” he said, with a smile
in his dark blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feminine in her caught the admiration behind them
and delightedly realized his confusion, the night before, at
her metamorphosis from the prim little black-frocked
quakeress into the radiant creature in furs and jewels
and flame-coloured audacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now you’re quite sure it is me—or I—which is
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m quite sure it’s my charming landlady who for
the second time feeds the hungry wanderer. Miss Gale,
Triona, makes a specialty of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, indeed, I’m peculiarly fortunate,” said Triona,
taking a tomato sandwich. “Will you feed me again,
Miss Gale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As often as you like,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s rather a rash promise to make to a professional
vagabond like myself. When he has begged his way
for months and months at a time, he comes to regard
other people’s food as his by divine right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you done that?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much worse. You don’t keep chickens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good thing. I think I’m the world’s champion
chicken-stealer. It’s a trick of legerdemain. You
dive at a chicken, catch it by its neck, whirl it round
and stick it under your jacket all in one action. The
unconscious owner has only to turn his back for a second.
Then, of course, you hide in a wood and have an orgy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not the desperate character he makes himself
out to be,” said Olifant. “He spent two months with
me at ‘The Towers’ without molesting one of your
hens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re not still there?” she asked Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, no,” he replied. “I suppose I have the fever of
perpetual change. I had a letter from Finland saying
that my presence might be of use there. So I have spent
this spring in Helsingfors. I am only just back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems wonderful to go and come among all these
strange places,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One land is much the same as another in essentials,”
replied Triona. “To carry on life you have to eat and
sleep. There’s no difference between a hard-boiled egg
in Somerset and a hard-boiled egg in Tobolsk. And sleep
is sleep, whether you’re putting up at Claridge’s or the
Hotel of the Beautiful Star. And human nature, stripped
of the externals of habits, customs, traditions, ceremonials,
is unchanging from one generation, and from one
latitude or longitude, to another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” objected Olivia, with a flash of logic, “if London’s
the same as Tobolsk, why yearn for Tobolsk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the hope of finding something different—the <span class='it'>ignis
fatuus</span>, the Jack o’ Lantern, the Will-o’-the-Wisp——”
He was silent for a moment, and then she caught the
flash of his eyes. “It’s the only thing that counts in
human progress. The Will-o’-the-Wisp. It leaves nine
hundred and ninety-nine men out of a thousand floundering
in a bog—but the thousandth man wins through to
the Land of Promise. There is only one thing in life
to do,” he continued, clenching his nervous hands and
looking into the distance away from Olivia, “and that
is never to lose faith in your <span class='it'>ignis fatuus</span>—to compel it
to be your guiding star. Once you’ve missed grip of it,
you’re lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had your Russian idealism,” said Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will you learn, my dear friend,” said Triona
quietly, “that I’m not a Russian? I’m as English as you
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s your idealism that is Russian,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so?” he asked, deferentially. “Well,
perhaps it is. In England you keep your ideals hidden
until some great catastrophe happens, then you bring
them out to help you along. Otherwise it is immodest
to expose them. In Russia, ideals are exposed all the
time, so that when the time for their application comes,
they’re worn so thin they’re useless. Poor Russia,” he
sighed. “It has idealized itself to extinction. All my
boyhood’s companions—the students, the <span class='it'>intelligentsia</span>,
as they called themselves, who used to sit and talk and
talk for hours of their wonderful theories—you in England
have no idea how Russian visionary can talk—and
I learned to talk with them—where are they now?
The fortunate were killed in action. The others, either
massacred or rotting in prisons, or leading the filthy
hunted lives of pariah dogs. The Beast arose like a
foul shape from the Witch’s cauldron of their talk .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
devoured them. Yes, perhaps the stolid English way
is the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about your Will-o’-the-Wisp theory?” asked
Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw out his hands. “Ah! That is the secret.
Keep it to yourself. Don’t point it out to a thousand
people, and say: ‘Join me in the chase of the Will-o’-the-Wisp.’
For the thousand other people will each see
an <span class='it'>ignis fatuus</span> of their own and point it out, so that there
are myriads of them, and your brain reels, and you’re
swallowed up in the bog to a dead certainty. In plain
words, every human being must have his own individual
and particular guiding star which he must follow steadfastly.
My guiding star is not yours, Miss Gale, nor
Olifant’s. We each have our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant smiled indulgently. “<span class='it'>Moscovus loquitur</span>,” he
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” asked Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says, my dear Miss Gale, that the Russian will
ever be talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure that I don’t approve,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona laid his hand on his heart and made a little
bow. She went on, casting a rebuking glance at Olifant,
who had begun to laugh:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, it’s more entertaining and stimulating to
talk about ideas than about stupid facts. Most people
seem to regard an idea as a disease. They shy at it as if
it were smallpox.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant protested. He was capable of playing football
with ideas as any man. Self-satirical, he asked was he
not of Balliol? Olivia, remembering opportunely a recent
Cambridge dinner neighbour’s criticism of the famous
Oxford College—at the time it had bored her indifferent
mind—and an anecdote with which he drove home his
remarks, that of a sixth-form contemporary who had
written to him in the prime flush of his freshman’s term:
“Balliol is not a college; it is a School of Thought,” cried
out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that rather a crude metaphor for Balliol?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They quarrelled, drifted away from the point, swept
Triona into a laughing argument on she knew not what.
All she knew was that these two men were giving her the
best of themselves; these two picked men of thought and
action; that they were eager to interest her, to catch her
word of approval; that some dancing thing within her
brain played on their personalities and kept them at
concert pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was conscious of a new joy, a new sense of power,
when the door opened and Myra showed in Lydia Dawlish.
She entered, enveloped in an atmosphere of furs
and creamy worldliness. Aware of the effect of implicit
scorn of snobbery, she besought Olifant for news of Medlow,
dear Sleepy Hollow, which she had not seen for
years. Had he come across her beloved eccentric of a
father—old John Freke? Olifant gave her the best of
news. He had lately joined the committee of the local
hospital, of which Mr. Freke was Chairman; professed
admiration for John Freke’s exceptional gifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he had gone out into the world, he might have been
a great man,” said Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>is</span> a great man,” replied Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the good of being great in an overlooked
chunk of the Stone Age like Medlow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke with her lazy vivacity, obviously, to Olivia’s
observant eye, seeking to establish herself with the two
men. But the spell of the afternoon was broken. As
soon as politeness allowed, Olifant and Triona took their
leave. Had it not been for Lydia they would have stayed
on indefinitely, forgetful of time, showing unconscious,
and thereby all the more flattering, homage to their
hostess. In a mild way she anathematized Lydia; but
found a compensating tickle of pleasure in the lady’s
failure to captivate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Olifant she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that you know where your landlady lives, I hope
you won’t go on neglecting her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she waited for Triona to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I ever have the pleasure of seeing you again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all depends whether you can be communicated
with,” she replied. “Alexis Triona, Esq., Planet Earth,
Solar System, is an imposing address; but it might puzzle
the General Post Office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Vanloo Hotel, South Kensington, is very much
more modest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s well for people to know where they can find
one another,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you should do me the honour of the slightest
thought of finding me——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll fix up something soon,” Lydia interrupted.
“I’m Miss Gale’s elderly, adopted aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia felt a momentary shock, as though a tiny bolt
of ice had passed through her. She sped a puzzled glance
at a Lydia blandly unconscious of wrong-doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be delighted,” said Triona politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the door had closed behind the two—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nice men,” said Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they’re rather—nice,” replied Olivia, wondering
why, in trying to qualify them in her mind, this particular
adjective had never occurred to her. They were male,
they spoke perfect English, they were well-mannered—and
so, of course, they were nice. But it was such an inadequate
word, completing no idea. Lydia’s atrophied
sense of differentiation awoke the laughter in her eyes.
Nice! So were Bobby Quinton, Sydney Rooke, Mauregard,
a score of other commonplace types in Lydia’s set.
But that Blaise Olifant and Alexis Triona should be
lumped with them in this vaguely designated category,
seemed funny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Major Olifant, of course, I knew from your description
of him; but the other—the young man with the
battered face—I didn’t place him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Triona—Alexis Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seem to have heard the name,” said Lydia. “He
writes or paints or lectures on Eugenics or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has written a book on Russia,” replied Olivia drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m fed up with Russia,” said Lydia dismissively.
“Even if I wasn’t—I didn’t come here to talk about it.
I came in about something quite different. What do you
think has happened? Sydney Rooke has asked me to
marry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s eyes flashed with the interest of genuine youth
in a romantic proposal of marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear!” she cried. “How exciting!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish it were,” said Lydia, in her grey-eyed calmness.
“Anyhow, it’s a bit upsetting. Of course I knew that
he was married—separated years and years from his wife.
Whether he couldn’t catch her out, or she couldn’t catch
him out, I don’t know. But they couldn’t get a divorce.
She was a Catholic and wouldn’t stand for the usual
arrangement. Now she’s dead. Died a couple of months
ago in California. He came in this morning with Lady
Northborough—introducing her—the first time I had seen
the woman. And he sat by and gave advice while she
chose half a dozen hats. His judgment’s infallible, you
know. He saw her to her car and came back. ‘Now
I’ve done you a good turn,’ he said, ‘perhaps you’ll do
me one. Give me five minutes with you in your cubby-hole.’
We went into my little office, and then he sprang
this on me—the death of his wife and the proposal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it <span class='it'>must</span> have been exciting,” Olivia protested.
“Yet——” she knitted her brow, “why the Lady Northborough
barrage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s his way,” said Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said I would give him my answer to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. He’s charming. He’s rolling in money—you
remember the motor-car I turned down for obvious
reasons—he knows all kinds of nice people—he’s
fifty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty!” cried Olivia, aghast. To three and twenty
fifty is senile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The widow’s ideal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s exciting, but not romantic,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Romance perished on the eleventh of November,
1918. Since then it has been ‘Every woman for herself
and the Devil take the hindmost.’ Are you aware that
there are not half enough men to go round? So when a
man with twenty thousand a year comes along, a woman
has to think like—like——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like Aristotle or Herbert Spencer, or the sailor’s
parrot,” said Olivia. “Of course, dear. But is he so
dreadfully wealthy as all that? What does he do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He attends Boards of Directors. As far as I can make
out he belongs to a Society for the Promotion of Un-christian
Companies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you care for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia shook her exquisitely picture-hatted head—she
was a creamy Gainsborough or nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that way, not a bit. Of course, he has been a real
good friend to me. But after all—marriage—it’s difficult
to explain——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of her cynicism, Lydia had always respected
the girlhood of her friend. But Olivia flung the scornful
arm of authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no need of explanation. I know all about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case——” said Lydia. She paused, lit a
cigarette, and with her large, feline grace of writhing
curves, settled herself more comfortably in the corner
of the couch—“I thought you would bring a fresh mind
to bear upon things. But no matter. In that case,
dear, what would you advise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the girl’s mental vision arose the man in question—the
old young man, the man of fifty, with the air
and manner and dress of the man of twenty-five; his
mark of superficial perfection that hid God knew what
strange sins, stoniness of heart and blight of spirit. She
saw him in his impeccable devotion to Lydia. But
something in the imagined sight of him sent a shiver
through her pure, yet not ignorant, maidenhood: something
of which the virginal within her defied definition,
yet something abhorrent. The motor-car had failed;
now the wedding-ring. She recaptured the fleeting, disquieting
sense of Lydia on her first evening in London—the
woman’s large proclamation of sex. Instinctively
she transferred her impression to the man, and threw a
swift glance at Lydia lying there, milk and white, receptive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A word once read and forgotten—a word in some
French or English novel—sprang to her mind, scraped
clear from the palimpsest of memory. Desirable. A
breath-catching, hateful word. She stood aghast and
shrinking on the edge of knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling child, what on earth is the matter with
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia started at the voice, as though awakening from
a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s horrible,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marrying a man you can no more love than—— Ugh!
I wouldn’t marry him for thousands of millions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? I want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the shiver in the girl’s soul could not be expressed
in words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a question of love,” she said lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia laughed, called her a romantic child. It was
not a question of love, but of compatible temperament.
Marriage wasn’t a week-end, but a life-end, trip. People
had to get accustomed to each other in dressing-gowns
and undress manners. She herself was sure that Sydney
Rooke would wear the most Jermyn Street of dressing-gowns,
at any rate. But the manners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll always be as polished as his finger-nails,”
said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why you should speak like that of Sydney,”
cried Lydia, with some show of spirit. “It’s rather ungrateful
seeing how kind he has been to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which was true; Olivia admitted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the man who is kind to you, in a social way, isn’t
always the man you would like to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s I, not you,” Lydia protested, “who am
going to marry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are going to marry him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see anything else to do,” replied Lydia, and
she went again over the twenty thousand a year argument.
Olivia saw that her hesitations were those of a cool brain
and not of an ardent spirit, and she knew that the brain
had already come to a decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite see,” said Lydia half apologetically, “that
you think I ought to wait until I fall in love with a man.
But I should have to wait till Doomsday. I thought I
was in love with poor dear Fred. But I wasn’t. I’m not
that sort. If Fred had gone on living I should have
gone on letting him adore me and have been perfectly
happy—so long as he didn’t expect me to adore him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t Mr. Rooke expect you to adore him?” asked
Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia laughed, showing her white teeth, and shook a
wise and mirthful head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m convinced that was the secret of his first unhappy
marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor lady adored him and bored him to frenzy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock on the mantelpiece struck the half-hour after
six. Lydia rose. She must go home and dress. She was
dining with Rooke at Claridge’s at eight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad we’ve had this little talk,” she said. “I
felt I must tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you wanted my advice,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you silly!” answered Lydia, gathering her furs
around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They exchanged the conventional parting kiss. Olivia
accompanied her to the landing. When the summoned
lift appeared and its doors clashed open, Lydia
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t like to take over that hat shop at a
valuation, would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens, no!” cried the astounded Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia laughed and waved a grey-gloved hand and disappeared
downwards, like the Lady of the Venusberg
in an antiquated opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia re-entered the flat thoughtfully, and sat down in
an arm-chair by the tiny wood fire in the sitting-room
grate. Lydia and Lydia’s galley, and all that it signified,
disturbed her more than ever. They seemed not only
to have no ideals even as ballast, but to have flung them
overboard like so many curse-ridden Jonahs. To what
soulless land was she speeding with them? And not
only herself, but the England, of which she, as
much as any individual, was a representative unit? Was
it for the reaching of such a haven that her brothers had
given their lives? Was it that she should reach such
a haven that her mother, instinct with heroic passion,
had sent Stephen Gale forth to death? Was it to guide
the world on this Lydian path that Blaise Olifant had
given an arm and young Triona had cheerfully endured
Dantesque torturings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra came in and began to remove the tea-things—Myra,
gaunt, with her impassive, inexpressible face,
correct in black; silk blouse, stuff skirt, silk apron.
Olivia, disturbed in her efforts to solve the riddle of existence,
swerved in her chair and half-humorously sought
the first human aid to hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra, tell me. Why do you go on living?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra made no pause in her methodical activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God put me into the world to live. It’s my duty to
live,” she replied in her toneless way. “And God ordained
me to live so that I should do my duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you think is your duty?” Olivia asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, of all people in the world, ought to know that,”
said Myra, holding the door open with her foot, so as to
clear a passage for the tea-tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia rested her elbows on the arms of the chair and
put her finger-tips to her temples. She felt at once rebuked
and informed with knowledge. Never before had
the Sphinx-like Myra so revealed herself. Probably she
had not had the opportunity, never having found herself
subjected to such direct questioning. Being so subjected,
she replied with the unhesitating directness of
her nature. The grace of humility descended on Olivia.
What fine spirit can feel otherwise than humble when
confronted with the selfless devotion of a fellow-being?
And further humbled was she by the implicit declaration
of an ideal, noble and purposeful, such as her mind for
the past few months had not conceived. This elderly,
spinsterly foundling, child of naught, had, according to
her limited horizon, a philosophy—nay, more—a religion
of life which she unswervingly followed. According to
the infinite scale whereby human values ultimately are
estimated, Olivia judged herself sitting in the galley of
Lydia Dawlish as of far less account than Myra, her
butt and her slave from earliest infancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and looked around the prettiness of taste and
colour with which she had transformed the original dully-furnished
room, and threw up her arm in a helpless gesture.
What did it all mean? What was she doing there?
On what was she squandering the golden hours of her
youth? To what end was she using such of a mind and
such of a soul as God had given her? At last, to sell herself
for furs and food and silk cushions, and for the society
of other women clamorous of nothing but furs and
food and silk cushions, to a man like Sydney Rooke—without
giving him anything in return save her outward
shape for him to lay jewels on and exhibit to the uninspiring
world wherein he dwelt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far better return to Medlow and lead the life of a
clean woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra entered. “You’re not dining out to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank God!” said Olivia. “I’ll slip on any old
thing and go downstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dined in her little quiet corner of the restaurant,
and after dinner took up Triona’s book, <span class='it'>Through Blood
and Snow</span>, which she had bought that morning, her previous
acquaintance with it having been made through a
circulating library. In the autumn she had read and been
held by its magic; but casually as she had read scores
of books. But now it was instinct with a known yet
baffling personality. It was two o’clock in the morning
before she went to bed.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> tastes of Alexis Triona were not such as to
lead him into extravagant living on the fruits of
his literary success. To quality of food he was
indifferent; wine he neither understood nor cared for;
in the use of other forms of alcohol he was abstemious;
unlike most men bred in Russia he smoked moderately,
preferring the cigarettes he rolled himself from Virginia
tobacco to the more expensive Turkish or Egyptian
brands. His attire was simple. He would rather walk
than be driven; and he regarded his back-bedroom at
the top of the Vanloo Hotel as a luxurious habitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had broken away from the easeful life at Medlow
because, as he explained to Blaise Olifant, it frightened
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m up against nothing here,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re up against your novel,” replied Olifant. “A
man’s work is always his fiercest enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona would not accept the proposition. He and his
novel were one and indivisible. Together they must
fight against something—he knew not what. Perhaps,
fight against time and opportunity. They wanted the
tense, stolen half-hours which he and his other book had
enjoyed. Would Olifant think him ungrateful if he
picked up and went on his mission to Helsingfors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow,” said Olifant, “the man who resents
a friend developing his own personality in his own way
doesn’t deserve to have a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like you to say that,” cried Triona. “I shall always
remember. When I get back I shall let you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Alexis Triona vanished from a uninspiring Medlow,
and two months afterwards gave Olifant his address at
the Vanloo Hotel. Olifant, tired by a long spell of close
work, went up for an idle week in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back and carry on as before,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Triona ran his fingers through his brown hair and
held out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The wise man never tries to repeat a past pleasure.
As a wise old Russian friend of mine used to say—never
relight a cigar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So after a few days of pleasant companionship in the
soberer delights of town, Blaise Olifant returned to Medlow
and Triona remained in his little back room in the
Vanloo Hotel.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>One night, a week or so after his visit to Olivia Gale,
he threw down his pen, read over the last sheet that he
had written, and, with a gesture of impatience, tore it
up. Suddenly he discovered that he could not breathe
in the stuffy bedroom. He drew back the curtains and
opened the window and looked out on myriad chimney-pots
and a full moon shining on them from a windless
sky. The bright air filled his lungs. Desire for wider
spaces beneath the moon shook him like a touch of claustrophobia.
He thrust on the coat which he had discarded,
seized a hat, and, switching off the light, hurried from the
room. He went out into the streets, noiseless save for
the rare, swift motors that flashed by like ghosts fleeing
terrified from some earthly doom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked and walked until he suddenly realized that
he had emerged from Whitehall and faced the moonlight
beauty of the Houses of Parliament standing in majestic
challenge against the sky, and the Abbey sleeping in its
centuries of dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away across the Square, by Broad Sanctuary, was the
opening of a great thoroughfare, and, as his eyes sought
it, he confessed to himself the subconscious impulse that
had led him thither. Yet was it not a cheat of a subconscious
impulse? Had he not gone out from the hotel
in Kensington with a definite purpose? As he crossed to
Broad Sanctuary and the entrance to Victoria Street, he
argued it out with himself. Anyhow, it was the most
fool of fool-errands. But yet—he shrugged his shoulders
and laughed. To what errand could a fool’s errand
be comparable? Only to that of one pixy-led. He
laughed at the thought of his disquisition to Olivia on
the Will-o’-the-Wisp. In the rare instances of the follower
of Faith had he not proclaimed its guidance to the
Land of Promise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days before he had seen her. He had been impelled
by an irresistible desire to see her. To call on her
without shadow of excuse was impossible. To telephone
or write an invitation to lunch was an act unsuggested by
his limited social experience. Taking his chance that
she should emerge between eleven and twelve, he strolled
up and down the pavement, so that at last when fate
favoured him and he advanced to meet her, they greeted
each other with a smiling air of surprise. They explained
their respective objectives. She was for buying a patent
coffee machine at the Army and Navy Stores, he for
catching an undesirable train at Victoria Station. A
threatening morning suddenly became a rainy noon. He
turned back with her and they fled together and just
reached the Stores in time to escape from the full fury of
the downpour. There he bent his mind on coffee machines.
His masculine ignorance of the whole art of
coffee-making, a flannel bag in a jug being his primitive
conception, moved her to light-hearted mirth. The purchase
made, the order given, they wandered idly through
the great establishment. They were prisoners, the outside
world being weltering deluge. For once in his lifetime,
thought Triona, the elements warred on his side.
A wringing machine, before which he paused in wonderment
at its possible use, and an eager description on
the part of the salesman, put Olivia on the track of a
game into which he entered with devoted fervour. Let
them suppose they were going to furnish a house. Oh!
a great big palace of a house. In imagination they bought
innumerable things, furnishing the mansion chiefly with
hammocks and marquees and garden chairs and lawn-mowers
and grand pianos and egg-whisks. Her heart,
that morning, attuned to laughter, brought colour into
her cheeks and brightness into her eyes. To the young
man’s ear she seemed to have an adorable gift of phrase.
She invested a rolling-pin with a humorous individuality.
She touched a tray of doughnuts with her fancy and
turned them into sacramental bread of Momus, exquisite
Divinity of Mirth. She was so free, so graceful,
so intimate, so irresistible. He followed her, a young man
bemused. What he contributed to the game he scarcely
knew. He was only conscious of her charm and her whipping
of his wit. They stumbled into the department of
men’s haberdashery. His brain conceived a daring idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been trying for weeks,” said he, “to make up my
mind to buy a tie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia glanced swiftly round and sped to a counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ties, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind?” asked the salesman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ordinary silk—sailor-knot. Show me all you’ve got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before his entranced eyes she selected half a dozen,
with a taste which the artist within him knew was impeccable.
He presented the bill bearing her number at the
cashier’s pigeon hole, and returning took the neat packet
from the salesman with the air of one receiving a decoration
from royalty. They made their way to the exit.
She said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid we’ve been criminally frivolous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If such happiness is a crime I’d willingly swing for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He noted a quick, uncomprehending question in her
glance and the colour mounted into his pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My English idiom is not yet perfect,” he said. “I
ought not to have used that expression.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia laughed at his discomfiture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s generally used by dreadful people who threaten to
do one another in. But the metaphor’s thrilling, all the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain had ceased. After a few moments the mackintoshed
commissionaire secured a taxi. Triona accompanied
her to the door. She thrust out a frank hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Au revoir. It has been delightful to find you so
human.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drove off. He stood, with a smile on his lips,
watching the vehicle disappear in the traffic. Her farewell
was characteristic. What could one expect of her
but the unexpected?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was three days ago. The image of her unconsciously
alluring yet frank to disconcertment, spiritually
feminine yet materially impatient of sex; the image of her
in the three separate settings—the dark-eyed princess in
fur and flame beneath the electric light of the theatre
portico; the slim girl in simple blouse and skirt who, over
the pretty teacups, held so nice a balance between Olifant
and himself; the gay playmate of a rainy hour, in her
fawn costume (he still felt the thrill of the friendly touch
of her fawn-coloured gloved hands on his sleeve)—the
composite image and vision of her had filled his sleeping
and waking thoughts to the destruction of his peace of
mind and the dislocation of his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, on this warm night of spring, he stood, the most
foolishly romantical of mortals, at the entrance to Victoria
Street, and with a shrug of his shoulders proceeded
on his errand of mute troubadour. Perhaps the day of
rapture might come when he would tell her how he stood
in the watches of the night and gazed up at what he
had to imagine was her window on the fifth floor of the
undistinguished barrack that was her home. It was
poetic, fantastic, Russian, at any rate. It would also
mark the end of his excursion; it was a fair tramp back
to South Kensington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An unheeded taxi-cab whizzed past him as he walked;
but a few seconds later, the faint sound of splintering
glass and then the scrunch of brakes suddenly applied
awoke him from his smiling meditations. The cab
stopped, sharply outlined in the clear moonlight. The
driver leaped from his seat and flung open the door. A
woman sprang out, followed by a man. Both were in
evening dress. Voices rose at once in altercation. Triona,
suspecting an accident, quickened his pace instinctively
into a run and joined the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the instinctive words passed his lips he became
amazedly conscious of Olivia standing there, quivering,
as white as the white dress and cloak she wore, her
eyes ablaze. She flashed on him a half-hysterical recognition
and clutched his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew himself up to his slim height and looked first
at the taxi driver and then at the heavy, swarthy man in
evening dress, and then at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter? Tell me,” he rapped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This man tried to insult me,” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia never knew how it happened: it happened like
some instantaneous visitation of God. The lithe young
figure suddenly shot forward and the heavy man rolled
yards away on the pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Serve him damn well right,” said the driver; “but
where do I come in with my window broken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you shall be paid, you shall be paid,” cried Olivia.
“Pay him, Mr. Triona, and let us go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona glanced up and down the street. “No, this
gentleman’s going to pay,” he said quietly and advanced
to the heavy man who had scrambled to unsteady feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just you settle up with that cabman, quick, do you
hear, or I’ll knock you down again. I could knock you
down sixty times an hour. And so help me, God, if a
copper comes in sight I’ll murder you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, all right,” said the man hurriedly. “I don’t
want a scandal for the lady’s sake.” He turned to the
taxi man. “How much do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the damage it’ll be a matter of ten pound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swarthy man in evening dress fished out his note-case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you are, you blackmailing thief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of your back-chat, or I’ll finish off what this
gentleman has begun,” said the taxi man, pocketing the
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until he saw summary justice accomplished, Triona
stood in the lee of the houses, his arm stretched protectingly
in front of Olivia. Then he drew her
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see the lady home. It’s only a few steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, sir. Good night, sir,” said the taxi man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved on. Immediately in the silence of the
night came the crisp exchange of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you a pound to take me to Porchester Terrace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’d give a pound to see you walk there,” said
the driver, already in his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw in the clutch and with a cheery “Good night”
passed the extravagantly encountered pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say miracles don’t happen, but one has happened
now,” said Olivia breathlessly. “If you hadn’t
come out of space——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do tell me something about it,” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said that profit-merchant had insulted you and
that was enough for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God! I’m so ashamed!” she cried, with a
wild, pretty gesture of her hands. “What will you think
of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mad words rushed through his brain, but before they
found utterance he gripped himself. He had, once more,
his hands on the controls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I think of you, Miss Gale, it would be wiser not
to say. I should like to hear what has occurred. But,
pardon me,” he said abruptly, noticing her curious, uneven
step, and glancing down instinctively at her feet,
“what has become of your shoe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My slipper—why, of course——” She halted, suddenly
aware of the loss. “I must have left it in the cab.
I stuck up my foot and reached for it and broke the window
with the heel. I also think I hit him in the face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems as though he was down and out before I
came up,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you hadn’t I don’t [know] how I should have carried on,”
she confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked down the wide, empty street. The moon
shone high above them, the girl in her elegance, the man in
his loose grey flannels and soft felt hat, an incongruous
couple, save for their common air of alert youth. And
while they walked she rapidly told her story. She had
been to Percy’s with the usual crowd, Lydia Dawlish her
nominal chaperone. The man, Edwin Mavenna, a city
friend of Sydney Rooke, whom she had met a half a dozen
times, had offered to drive her home in his waiting taxi.
Tired, dependent for transport on Rooke and Lydia, who
desired a further hour of the night club’s dismal
jocundity, and angry with Bobby Quinton, who seemed
to think that her ear had no other function than to listen
to tales of sentimenti-financial woe, she had accepted.
Half-way home she had begun to regret; three-quarters
of the way she had been frightened. As they turned into
Victoria Street she had managed to free her arm and wield
the victorious slipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never go to that abominable place again as long as
I live,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should, if I were you,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d go once or twice, at any rate. To show yourself
independent of it. To prove to yourself that you’re not
frightened of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am frightened of it. On the outside it’s as
respectable as Medlow Parish Church on Sunday. But
below the surface there’s all sorts of hideousness—and
I’m frightened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not,” said he. “Things may startle you,
infuriate you, put you off your equilibrium; but they
don’t frighten you. They didn’t this evening. I’ve seen
too many people frightened in my time not to know.
You’re not that sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached the door of the Mansions. She
smiled at him, her gaiety returning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re as comforting and consoling a Knight Errant
as one could wish to meet. The damsel in distress is
greatly beholden to you. But how the—whatever
you like—you managed to time the rescue is beyond my
comprehension.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stars guided me,” he replied, with an upward
sweep of the hand. “Mortals have striven to comprehend
them for thousands of years—but without success. I
started out to wander about this great city—I often do
for hours—I’m a born wanderer—with the vagabond’s
aimlessness and trust in chance, or in the stars—and this
time the stars brought me where it was decreed that I
should be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was speaking she had opened the door with
her latchkey and now stood, shimmering white in the
gloom of the entrance. She held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’ve been too much occupied in trying not
to seem frightened and silly to thank you decently for
what you’ve done. But I am grateful. You don’t know
how grateful. I’ll have to tell you some other time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated for a moment. “Yes, to-morrow,” she
replied softly. “I shall be in all day. Goodnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the swift handshake the door closed on the enraptured
young man, and the hard, characterless street,
down which he seemed to dance, became transformed
into a moonlit glade of fairyland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was four o’clock in the morning when he entered his
back-bedroom at the Vanloo Hotel. But he did not sleep.
He had no desire for sleep—youth resenting the veil
drawn across a consciousness so exquisitely alive. Sleep,
when the stars in their courses were fighting for him?
Impossible, preposterous! Let him rather live, again
and again, over the night’s crowded adventure. Every
detail of it set his pulses throbbing. The mere glorious
first recognition of her was the thrill of a lifetime.
He constructed and reconstructed the immortal picture.
The moonlit, silent street, its high, decorous
buildings marked by the feeble gas lamps melting into
an indeterminate vanishing point. The clear-cut scene.
The taxi-cab. The three human figures. The stunted
driver. The massive, dark man, in silk hat which reflected
the moonlight, in black overcoat thrown open,
revealing a patch of white shirt and waistcoat; the
slender, quivering, white form draped in white fur, white
gossamer, white what-not, crowned with dark glory of
eyes and hair. The masculine in him exulted in his
physical strength and skill—in the clean, straight, elementary
yet scientific left-hander that got the hulking
swine between the eyes and sent him reeling and sprawling
and asking for no more punishment. And then—oh,
it was a great thing to command, to impose his
will. To walk in triumph off with the wonderful lady of
his dreams. To feel, as she thanked him, that here was
something definite that he had done for her, something
with a touch of the romantic, the heroic, which, in its
trivial way, justified belief in the incidents of his adventurous
career which he had so modestly, yet so vividly
described in the book that had brought him fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this point of justification he was peculiarly sensitive.
Various Englishmen, soldiers sent out on secret missions
to the fringes of the areas of his activities, had questioned
many of his statements, both in the book and in
descriptive articles which he had written for newspapers
and other periodicals, and asked for proofs. And he had
replied, most cogently, that the sphere of the Russian
Secret Service in which he was employed was, of necessity,
beyond the ken of the secret service of any other Power
in Europe, and that official proofs were lost in the social
and political disintegration of Russia. One man, a great
man, speaking with unquestionable authority, silenced
the horde of cavillers as far as events prior to 1917 were
concerned. But there were still some who barked annoyingly
at his heels. Proofs, of course, he had none to give.
How can a man give proofs when he is cast up, practically
naked, on the coast of England? He must be believed or
not. And it was the haunting terror of this sensitive boy
of genius, whose face and eyes bore the ineffaceable marks
of suffering, that he should lose the credit which he had
gained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At all hazards he must allow no doubts to arise in the
mind of Olivia. To fight them down he would do all
manner of extravagant things. He regretted the pusillanimous
tameness of his late opponent. If the man had
only picked himself up and given battle! If only there
had been half a dozen abductors or insulters instead of
one! His spirits (at seven o’clock) sank at the logical
conclusion that the conventional conditions of post-war
civilized life afforded a meagre probability of the recurrence
of such another opportunity. He had the temperament
of those whose hunger is only whetted by triumph,
to whom attainment only gives vision of new heights.
When, after tossing sleepless in his bed, he rose and
dressed at nine, he had decided that, in knocking down a
mere mass of unresisting flesh, he had played a part
almost inglorious, such as any stay-at-home <span class='it'>embusqué</span>
could have played. By not one jot or tittle did his act
advance the credibility of his story. And on his story
alone could he found his hopes of finding favour in her
marvellous eyes. Of the touch of genius that inspired
his literary work he thought little. At this stage of his
career he was filled with an incredulous wonder at his
possession of a knack which converted a page of scribble
into a cheque upon a bank. His writing meant money.
Not money, wealth, on the grand scale; but money to
keep him as a modest gentleman on the social grade to
which he had attained, and to save him from the detested
livery of the chauffeur. The story which he was telling
in the new book was but a means to this end. The
story which he had told was life itself. Nay, now it was
more: it was love itself; it was a girl who was more than
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called at the Victoria Street flat at twelve o’clock.
The austere Myra looked on him disapprovingly. Tea-time
was the visiting time for stray young men, and even
then she conveyed to them the impression that she let
them in on sufferance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What name?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Gale is in, sir,” she admitted grudgingly, having
received explicit orders from Olivia, “but she is dressing
and I don’t know whether she can see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell Miss Gale that I am entirely at her service,
and if it’s inconvenient for her to see me now I’ll
call later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra left him standing in the little vestibule and gave
the message to Olivia, who, fully dressed, was polishing
her nails in her bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the most impossible woman on earth,” Olivia
declared, turning on her. “Is that the way you
would treat a man who had delivered you from a
dragon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t hold with men and I don’t hold with dragons,”
replied Myra unmoved. “The next time you’ll be wanting
me to fall over a dragon who has delivered you from
a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia scarcely listened to the retort. She flew out and
carried the waiting Triona into the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry. My maid’s a terror. She bites and
doesn’t bark. But I guarantee her non-venomous. How
good of you to come so early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was anxious,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last night must have been a shock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it was,” she laughed; “but not enough to
keep me all day long in fainting fits with doctors and
smelling-bottles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you slept all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she replied frankly. “That I didn’t do. The
adventure was a bit too exciting. Besides——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It came into my head to make up my moral balance
sheet. Figures of arithmetic always send me to sleep;
but figures of—well, of that kind of thing, don’t you
know—keep me broad awake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s dark, eager face was of the kind that shows the
traces of fatigue in faint shadows under the eyes. He
swiftly noted them and cried out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re dead tired. It’s damnable.” He rose, suddenly
angry. “You ought to go to bed at once. Your
maid was right. I had no business to come at this hour
and disturb you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you hadn’t come,” said Olivia, inwardly glowing at
the tribute paid by the indignant youth, “I should have
imagined that you looked on last night’s affair as a trumpery
incident in the day’s work and went to bed and forgot
all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s impossible,” said he. “I, too, haven’t slept a
wink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met and held his eyes longer than she, or anyone
else, had held them. Then, half angrily, she felt her
cheeks grow hot and red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For you, who have faced death a hundred times, last
night, as I’ve just said, must be even dull. What was
it to the night when you—you know—the sentry—when
you were unarmed and you fought with him and you
killed him with his own bayonet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snapped his fingers and smiled. “That was unimportant.
Whether I lived or died didn’t matter to anybody.
It didn’t matter much to me. It was sheer
animal instinct. But last night it was you. And that
makes a universe of difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia rose, and, with a “You’re not smoking,” offered
him a box of cigarettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, when he had lighted it, with fingers
trembling ever so slightly as they held the match, “I suppose
a woman does make a difference. We’re always in
the way, somehow. Women and children first. Why
they don’t throw us overboard at once and let the really
useful people save themselves, I could never make out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His air of dismay was that of a devotee listening to a
saint blaspheme. Her laughter rippled, music to his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what I should like to do? Get out of
London for a few hours and fill my lungs with air. Richmond
Park, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, too.” He sighed. “If only I had a car!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are such things as motor-buses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang to delighted feet. His divinity on a bus top!
It was like the Paphian goddess condescending from her
dove-drawn chariot to the joggle of a four-wheeler cab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you really go on one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would. She would start forthwith. The time
only to put on a hat. She left him to his heart-beats of
happiness, presently to re-appear, hatted, gloved, and
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re quite sure you would like to come? Your
work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My work needs the open air as much as I do,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went forth, boy and girl on a jaunt, and side by
side on the top of the omnibus they gave themselves up
to the laughter of the pure sunshine. At Richmond they
lunched, for youth must be fed, and afterwards went
through the streets of the old town, and stood on the
bridge watching the exquisite curve of the river embosomed
in the very newest of new greenery, and let its
loveliness sink into their hearts. Then they wandered
deep into the Park and found a tree from beneath which
they could see the deer browsing in the shade; and there
they sat, happy in their freedom and isolation. What
they said, most of the time, was no great matter. Of
the two, perhaps she talked the more; for he had said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so tired of talking about myself. I have been
obliged to, so that it has become a professional habit.
And what there is to be known about me, you know.
But you—you who have lived such a different life from
mine—I know so little of you. In fact, I’ve known nothing
of English women such as you. You’re a mystery.
Tell me about yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she had begun:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I was born—I shan’t tell you the year—of poor
but honest parents——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, led on by his eager sympathy and his intimate
knowledge of her home, she had abandoned the jesting
note and talked simply and frankly of her secluded
and eventless life. With feminine guile, and with last
night’s newborn mistrust of men, she set a little trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever go into my mother’s room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. Perhaps that was the one—the
best bedroom—which Olifant always kept locked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt ashamed of her unworthy suspicion; glad at
the loyal keeping of a promise, to the extent of not allowing
a visitor even a peep inside the forbidden chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Blaise Olifant is one of the finest types England
breeds,” she said warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a touch of jealous fear in his swift glance;
but he replied with equal warmth:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t tell me that. Brave, modest, of sensitive
honour—Ah! A man with a mind so cultivated that he
seems to know nothing until you talk with him, and then
you find that he knows everything. I love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to hear you say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Do you admire him so much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t that,” she parried. “It’s on your account.
One man’s generous praise of another does one’s heart
good.” She threw out her arms as though to embrace
the rolling park of infinite sward and majestic trees. “I
love big things,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Alexis Triona thanked his stars for having
led him along the true path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can say that, in after years, these twain, when
they shall have grown old and have gone through whatever
furnaces Fate—either personal destiny or the Fate
of Social Institutions—may prepare for them, will not
retain imperishable memories of the idyll of that sweet
spring day? There they sat, youth spiritually communing
with youth; the girl urged by feminine instinct to
love him for the dangers he had passed; the young man
aflame with her beauty, her charm, her dryad elusiveness.
Here, for him, was yet another aspect of her, free,
unseizable in the woodland setting. And for her, another
aspect of him, the simple, clean-cut Englishman, divested
of vague and disquieting Russian citizenship, the perfect
companion, responsive to every chord struck by the spirit
of the magic afternoon. In the years to come, who can
say that they will not remember this sweet and delicate
adventure of their souls creeping forth in trembling
reconnaissance one of the other? Perhaps it will be a
more precious memory to the woman than to the man.
Men do not lay things up in lavender as women do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he had spoken, declared his passion in lover’s set
terms, perhaps her heart might have been caught by the
glamour of it all, and she might have surrendered to his
kisses, and they might have journeyed back to London
in a state of unreprehensible yet commonplace beatitude.
And the memory would possibly have been marked by a
white stone rising stark in an airless distance. But he
did not speak, held back by a rare reverence of her maidenhood
and her perfect trust; and in her heart flowered
gratitude for his sensitiveness to environment. So easy
for a maladroit touch to mar the perfection of an exquisite
hour of blue mist and mystery. So, again, who
knows but that in the years to come the memory will be
marked by a fragrance, a shimmer of leaves, a haze over
green sward, incorporated impalpably with the dear
ghost of an immortal day?</p>

<p class='pindent'>They returned on the top of the omnibus, rather late,
and on the way they spoke little. Now and then he
glanced sideways at her and met her eyes and caught her
smile, and felt content. At the terminus of the omnibus
route, in the raging, busy precincts of the stations of
Victoria, they alighted. He walked with her to her door
in Victoria Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your words have been singing in my ears,” said he:
“ ‘I love big things.’ To me, to-day has seemed a big
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ve loved it,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sped up to her room somewhat dazed, conscious of
need to keep her balance. So much had happened in the
last four-and-twenty hours. The shudder of the night
had still horrified her flesh when she drew the young man
out into the wide daylight and the open air; and now it
had passed away, as though it had never been, and a new
quivering of youth, taking its place, ran like laughter
through her bodily frame and her heart and her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m. Your outing seems to have done you good,”
said the impassive Myra, letting her in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first day’s escape from a fœtid prison,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you know what you’re talking about,” said
Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia laughed and threw her arm round Myra’s lean
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ain’t much to look at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, flushing, turned on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew a more abominable woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re lucky,” retorted Myra, and faded away
into her kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, mirthful, uplifted, danced, as it were, into the
sitting-room and began to pull off her gloves. Suddenly
her glance fell on a letter lying on her writing table. She
frowned slightly as she opened it, and as she read the
frown grew deeper. It was from Bobby Quinton. What
his dearest of dear ladies would think of him he left on
the joint knees of the gods and of his dearest lady—but—but
the wolves were at his heels. He had thrown
them all that he possessed—fur coat, watch and chain,
diamond studs, and, having gulped them all, they were
still in fierce pursuit. In a fortnight would he have
ample funds to satisfy them. But now he was at bay.
He apologized for the mixture of metaphor. But still,
there he was <span class='it'>aux abois</span>. Fifty pounds, just for a fortnight.
Could the dearest of dear ladies see her way——-?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to her desk and wrote out a cheque which
she enclosed in an envelope. To save her soul alive she
could not have written Bobby Quinton an accompanying
line.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span><span class='sc'>ERE</span>, all in a rush of twenty-four hours, was a
glut of incident for a young woman out for
adventure. Triona had only made his effect
on the romantically feminine within Olivia by his triumphant
rescue. As to that he need have no misgivings.
So once did Andromeda see young Perseus, calm and
assured, deliver her from the monster. Triona’s felling
of Mavenna appealed to the lingering savage woman
fiercely conscious of wrong avenged; but his immediate
and careless mastery of the situation struck civilized
chords. She could see him dominating the sheepskin-clad
tribe in the Urals (see <span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span>) until
he established their independence in their mountain
fastness. She could see him, masterful, resourceful,
escaping from the Bolshevik prison and making his
resistless way across a hostile continent. She could also
appreciate, after this wonder-day at Richmond, the
suppleness of his simple charm which won him food and
shelter where food scarcely existed and shelter to a stranger
was a matter of shooting or a bashing in of heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Mavenna, her flesh still shuddered at the memory
of those few moments of insult. What he said she
could scarcely remember. The inextricable clutch of
his great arms around her body and the detestable kisses
eclipsed mere words. Unwittingly his hug had compressed
her throat so that she could not scream. There
had been nothing for it but the slipper unhooked by the
free arm, and the doughty heel. Had she won through
alone to her room, she would have collapsed—so she
assured herself—from sickening horror. But the Deliverer
had been there, as in a legend of Greece or
Broceliande, and had saved her from the madness of the
nymph terror stricken by Satyrs. The two extravagances
had, in a way, counteracted each other, setting
her, by the morning, in a normal equilibrium. She had
tried to explain the phenomenon by referring to her having
spent the night in striking a moral balance-sheet.
And then had come the day, the wonderful day, in which
the Deliverer had proved himself the perfect, gentle
Knight. Can it be wondered that her brain swam with
him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went the next morning to Lydia’s hat shop, and,
in the little room which Sydney Brooke had called her
cubby hole, a nine-foot-square boudoir office, reeking
with Lydia’s scent and with Heaven knows what scandals
and vulgarities and vanities of post-war London, she
poured out her tale of outrage. After listening with
indulgent patience, Lydia remarked judicially:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you, my dear child, when you came to London,
that the first lesson you had to learn was to take care of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia flashed. She had taken care of herself well
enough. But that brute Mavenna—what about him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody knows Mavenna,” replied Lydia. “No
girl in her senses would have trusted herself alone with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, with that reputation, he’s a friend of yours and
Sydney’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia shrugged her plump shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, my dear, if one exacted certificates of lamb-like
innocence, signed by a high celestial official, before
you admitted anyone into the circle of your acquaintance,
you might as well go and live on a desert island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this man’s a beast and you’ve known it all
along!” cried Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only in one way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—my God! Isn’t that enough?” Olivia stood,
racked with disgust and amazement, over her mild-eyed,
philosophic friend. “What would you have done if
you had been in my place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could never have been in your place,” said Lydia.
“I should have been too wise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The knowledge of men, my dear, is the beginning of
wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I ought to have known?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. At any rate, you’ll know in the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall. You may be dead certain I shall,” declared
Olivia, in her anger and excitement seizing a puckered
and pleated cushion from the divan by which she stood.
“And if even I—−-”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, darling; you’ll tear it,” said Lydia calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia heaved the cushion back impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I want to know is this. Are you and Sydney
going to remain friends with Mavenna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid we’ll have to,” replied Lydia. “Mavenna
and Sydney are in all sorts of big things together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, when next you see him, Lydia, look well into
his face and ask him what he thinks of the heel of my
slipper and Mr. Triona’s fist. He’s not only a beast.
He’s a worm. When I think of him picking himself up,
after being knocked down by a man half his size——”
She laughed a bit hysterically. “Oh—the creature is
outside the pale!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia shook her fair head. “I’m sorry for you, my
dear. But he’s inside all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m not going to be inside with him!” cried
Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, like a little dark dust storm, she swirled out of
the office and, through the shop, into the freedom and
spaciousness of the streets. And that, for Olivia, was
the end of night clubs and dancing as a serious aim in
life, and a host of other vanities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few mornings afterwards Lydia sailed into the flat
and greeted Olivia as though nothing had happened.
She seemed to base her philosophy of life on obliteration
of the past, yesterday being as dead as a winter’s day of
sixty years ago. Would Olivia lunch with Sydney and
herself at some riverside club? Sydney, having collected
Mauregard, would be calling for them with the car. The
day was fine and warm; the prospect of the cool lawn
reaching down to the plashing river allured, and she liked
Mauregard. Besides, she had begun to take a humorous
view of Lydia. She consented. Lydia began to
talk of her wedding, fixed for the middle of July, of the
clothes that she had and the clothes that she hadn’t—the
ratio of the former to the latter being that of a loin-cloth
to the stock of Selfridge’s. When she was serious
minded, Lydia always expressed herself in terms of raiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll have to get some things, too, as you’re
going to be bridesmaid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I?” asked Olivia, this being the first she had
heard of it. “And who’s going to be best man—Mavenna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia looked aghast. So might a band of primitive
Christians have received a suggestion of inviting the
ghost of Pontius Pilate to a commemorative supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child, you don’t suppose we’re going to ask
that horror to the wedding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other day,” Olivia remarked drily, “I understood
that you and Sydney loved him dearly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia sighed. “I’m beginning to believe that you’ll
never understand anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the breach, if breach there were, was healed.
Olivia, relating the matter to Triona at their next meeting,
qualified Lydia’s attitude as one of callous magnanimity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile her intimacy with the young man began to
ripen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening Janet Philimore invited her to dine at the
Russian circle of a great womans’ club, which was entertaining
Triona at dinner. This was the first time she
had seen him in his character of modest lion; the first
time, too, she had been in a company of women groping,
however clumsily, after ideals in unsyncopated time.
The thin girl next to her, pretty enough, thought Olivia,
if only she had used a powder puff to mitigate the over-assertiveness
of a greasy skin, and had given less the
impression of having let out her hair to a bird for nesting
purposes, and had only seized the vital importance
of colour—the untrue greeny daffodil of her frock not
being the best for a sallow complexion—the girl next
to her, Agnes Blenkiron, started a hectic conversation
by enquiring what she was going to do in Baby Week.
The more ignorant Olivia professed herself to be of
babies and their antecedents, especially the latter, the
more indignantly explicit became Miss Blenkiron. Olivia
listened until she had creepy sensations around the roots
of her hair and put up an instinctive hand to assure herself
that it was not standing on end. Miss Blenkiron
talked feminist physiology, psychology, sociological therapeutics,
until Olivia’s brain reeled. Over and over
again she tried to turn to her hostess, who fortunately
had a pleasant male and middle-aged neighbour, but the
fair lady, without mercy, had her in thrall. She learned
that all the two or three thousand members of the club
were instinct with these theories and their aims. She
struggled to free herself from the spell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought we were here to talk about Russia,” she
ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we are talking about Russia.” Miss Blenkiron
shed on her the lambency of her pale blue eyes. “The
future of the human race lies in the hands of the millions
of Russian babies lying in the bodies of millions of
Russian women just waiting to be born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flash of the devil saved Olivia from madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a gigantic conception,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” Miss Blenkiron agreed, unhumorously, and
continued her work of propaganda, so that by the time
the speeches began Olivia found herself committed
to the strenuous toil of a lifetime as a member of she
knew not what societies. The only clear memory she
retained was that of a tea engagement some Sunday in
a North London garden city where Miss Blenkiron and
her brother frugally entertained the advanced thinkers
of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of the sense of release from something vampiric,
when the speeches hushed general conversation, she
recognized that the strange talk had been revealing and
stimulating, and she brought a quickened intelligence to
the comprehension of the gathering. To all these women
the present state of the upheaved world was of vast significance.
In Lydia’s galley no one cared a pin about it,
save Sydney Rooke, who cursed it for its interference
with his income. But here, as was clearly conveyed in
the opening remarks of the chairwoman, a novelist of
distinction, every one was intellectually concerned with
its infinite complexity of aspect. To them, the guest
of the evening, emerging as he had done from the dizzying
profundities of the whirlpool, was a figure of uncanny
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the first-hand knowledge of men like him that
is vital,” Miss Blenkiron whispered when the chairwoman
sat down. “I should so much like to meet him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you?” said Olivia. “That’s easily managed.
He’s a great friend of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she was subridently conscious of having acquired
vast and sudden merit in her neighbour’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona pleased her beyond expectation. The function,
so ordinary to public-dinner-going London, was new to
her. She magnified the strain that commonplace, even
though sincere, adulation could put upon a guest of
honour. She felt a twinge of apprehension when he
stood up, in his loose boyish way, and brushing his
brown hair from his temples, began to speak. But in a
moment or two all such feelings vanished. He spoke
to this assembly of a hundred, mostly women, much as,
in moments of enthusiasm, he would speak to her. And,
indeed, often catching her eye, he did speak to her, subtly
and flatteringly bringing her to his side. Her heart beat
a bit faster when, glancing around and seeing every one
hanging on his words, she realized that she alone, of all
this little multitude, held a golden key to the mystery
of the real man. There he talked, with the familiar
sway of the shoulders, and, when seeking for a phrase,
with the nervous plucking of his lips; talked in his
nervous, picturesque fashion, now and then with a touch
of the poet, consistently modest, only alluding to personal
experience to illustrate a point or to give verisimilitude
to a jest. He developed his feminist theme logically,
dramatically, proving beyond argument that the future
of civilization lay in the hands of the women of the civilized
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a great success. Woman, although she knows
it perfectly well, loves to be told what she wants and the
way to get it: she will never follow the way, of course,
having a tortuous, thorny, and enticing way of her own;
but that doesn’t matter. The principle, the end, that
is the thing: it justifies any amazing means. He sat
down amid enthusiastic applause. Flushed, he sought
Olivia’s distant gaze and smiled. Then she felt, thrillingly,
that he had been speaking for her, for her alone,
and her eyes brightened and flashed him a proud message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met him a while later in the thronged drawing-room
of the club, rather a shy and embarrassed young
man, heading a distinct course toward her through a
swarm of kind yet predatory ladies. She admired the
simple craftsmanship of his approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you going to get home?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The adorable carelessness of twenty shrugged its
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. The Lord will provide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can’t find a taxi, will you walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question implied a hope, so obvious that she
laughed gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are buses also and tubes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In which you can’t travel alone at this time of night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scoffed: “Oh, can’t I?” But his manifest fear
that she should encounter satyrs in train or omnibus
pleased her greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father’s dining at his club close by and is calling
for me. He will see that you get home safely,” said
Janet Philimore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s miles out of your way, dear,” said Olivia. “I’ll
put myself in the hands of Mr. Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, taxis being unfindable, they walked together
through the warm London night to Victoria Street. It
was then that he spoke of his work, the novel just completed.
Of all opinions on earth, hers was the one he
most valued. If only he could read it to her and have
the priceless benefit of her judgment. Secretly flattered,
she modestly depreciated, however, her critical powers.
He persisted, attributing to her unsuspected qualities
of artistic perception. At last, not reluctantly, she
yielded. He could begin the next evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reading took some days. Olivia, new to creative
work, marvelled exceedingly at the magic of the artist’s
invention. The personages of the drama, imaginary he
said, lived as real beings. She regarded their creation
as uncanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how do you know she felt like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shrugged his shoulders and smiled. “I can’t
conceive her feeling otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, for all her wonder, she brought her swift intelligence
to the task of criticism. Not since her mother’s
illness had she taken anything so seriously. She lived
in the book, walking meanwhile through an unreal world.
Her golden words, on the other hand, the young man
captured eagerly and set down in the margin of the manuscript.
Half-way through the reading, they were on
terms of Christian names. Minds so absorbed in an
artistic pursuit grew impatient of absurd formalities of
address. They slipped almost imperceptibly into the
Olivia and Alexis habit. At the end they pulled themselves
up rather sharply, with blank looks at an immediate
future bereft of common interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to begin another, right away, so that you
can be with me from the very start,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you an idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will you have one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t know. What man spent with the creative
effort of a novel has the vitality to beget another right
away? He feels that the very last drop of all that he
has known and suffered and enjoyed has been used to
the making of the book. For the making of another
nothing is left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I’ll have to lie fallow for a week or so,”
said the young optimist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as soon as things begin to sprout you’ll let me
know?” asked Olivia, forgetful that before harvest there
must be seed time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He promised; went home and cudgelled tired brains;
also cudgelled, for different reasons, an untired and restless
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let him make good, not ephemerally as the picturesque
narrator of personal adventure, but definitely, with
this novel as the creative artist—the fervent passion of
his life—and he would establish himself in her eyes, in
her mind, in her heart; so that treading solid ground,
he could say to her: “This is what I am, and for what
I am, take me. All that has gone before was but a crude
foundation. I had to take such rubbish and rubble as
I could find to hand.” But until then, let him regard
her as a divinity beyond his reach, rendering her service
and worship, but forbearing to soil her white robe with
a touch as yet unhallowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many a time, they could have read no more that day.
Just one swift movement, glance or cry on the part of
the man, and the pulses of youth would have throbbed
wildly together. He knew it. The knowledge was at
once his Heaven and his Hell. A less sensitive human
being would not have appreciated the quivering and vital
equipoise. Many a time he parted from her with the
farewell of comradely intimacy on his lips, and when
the lift had deposited him on the street level his heart
had been like lead and his legs as water, so that he
stumbled out into the lamp-lit dark of night like a paralytic
or a drunken man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that which was good in him warred fiercely against
temptations more sordid. As far as he knew, she was
a woman of fortune. So did her dress, her habit of life,
her old comfort-filled Medlow home, proclaim her. Of
her social standing as the daughter of Stephen Gale who
bawled out bids for yelts and rams in the Medlow market
place, he knew or understood very little. Her fortune
was a fact. His own, the few hundreds which he
had gained by <span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span>, was rapidly
disappearing. The failure of the new book meant starvation
or reversion to Cherbury Mews. Married to a
woman with money he could snap his fingers at crust or
livery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For the time he conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The end of the reading coincided more or less with
Midsummer quarter-day. Bills from every kind of coverer
or adorner of the feminine human frame fell upon
her like a shower of autumn leaves. She sat at her small
writing desk, jotted down the amounts, and added them
up with a much sucked pencil point. The total was
incredible. With fear at her heart she rushed round to
her bank for a note of her balance. It had woefully
decreased since January. Payment of all these bills
would deplete it still more woefully. The rent of “The
Towers” and the diminishing income on the deposit
account were trivial items set against her expenditure.
She summoned Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re heading for bankruptcy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any fool could see that,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are we going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Live like Christians instead of heathens,” replied
Myra. “If you would come to Chapel with me one Sunday
night you could be taught how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Myra failed. She belonged to a Primitive Non-Conformist
Communion whose austere creed and drab
ceremonial had furnished occasion for Olivia’s teasing
wit since childhood. Heathendom, ever divorced from
Lydian pleasures, presented infinitely more reasons for
existence than Myra’s Calvinism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems funny that a dear old thing like you can
revel in the idea of Eternal Punishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t got much else to revel in, have I?” said
Myra grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that’s true,” said Olivia thoughtfully.
“But it isn’t my fault, is it? If you had wanted to
revel, mother and I would have been the last people to
prevent you. Why not begin now? Go and have a
debauch at the pictures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You began by talking of bankruptcy,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you prescribed little Bethel. I’d sooner go
broke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have your own way, as usual,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I go broke, what’ll you do?” asked Olivia,
unregenerately enjoying the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I’ll have to put you together again,” replied
Myra, with no sign of emotion on her angular, withered
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia leaped from her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That can’t be,” said Myra, “seeing that it was I
as brought you up.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>That was the end of the argument. Olivia recognized
in Myra every useful quality save that of the financier.
She dismissed Myra from her counsels. But the state
of her budget cost her a sleepless night or two. At the
present rate of expenditure a couple of years would see
her penniless. For the first time since her emancipation
from Medlow fetters she had the feeling of signing her
own death-warrant on every cheque. Heroic resolves
were born of these days of depression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a climax to her worries, came Bobby Quinton, one
afternoon. What had he done to offend his dearest of
ladies? Why had she stopped the dancing lessons?
Why did Percy’s see her no more?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m fed up with Percy’s and the whole gang,” said
Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not including me, surely?” cried the young man, with
a dog’s appeal in his melting brown eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was kind. At first, she had not the heart to pack
him off to the froth and scum of social life to which he
belonged. He had the charm of unsuccessful youth so
pathetic in woman’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are,” said he, “I’m done for. I’ve no one
to look to but you, in the wide world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was responsibility for the safety of a human soul.
Olivia gave him sound advice, repeating many an old
argument and feeling enjoyably maternal. But when
Bobby grew hysterical, and, with mutation of sex, quoted
the Indian Love Lyrics and professed himself prepared
to die beneath her chariot wheels, and threatened to do
so if she disregarded his burning passion, she admonished
him after the manner of twentieth-century maidenhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good Bobby, don’t be an ass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bobby persisted in being an ass, with the zeal
of the dement. He became the fervent lover of the
cinquecento Bandello—and, with his dark eyes and hair,
looked the part. Imploring he knelt at the feet of the
divinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all very well, my dear boy,” said Olivia, unmoved
by his rhapsody, “all very nice and all very beautiful.
But what do you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course he wanted her to marry him, there and then:
to raise him from the Hell he was in to the Heaven where
she had her pure habitation. With her he could do
great things. He guaranteed splendid achievements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before a woman marries a man,” said Olivia, “she
rather wants an achievement or two on account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t love me, you don’t trust me?” exclaimed
the infatuated young man, ruffling his sleek black
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say that I do,” replied Olivia, growing weary.
“If you tell me what sort of fascination you possess,
I’ll give it due consideration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I may as well go away and blow my brains out,”
he cried tragically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might better go and use such brains as you have
in doing a man’s work,” retorted Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reproached her mournfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How unkind you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you came here as a window-cleaner or a lift porter
I might be kinder. You’re quite a nice boy,” she went
on after a pause, “otherwise I shouldn’t have anything
to do with you. But you haven’t begun to learn the
elements of life. You’re utterly devoid of the sense of
duty or responsibility. Like the criminal, you know.
Oh, don’t get angry. I’m talking to you for your good.
Pretending to teach idle women worthless dancing isn’t
a career for a man. It’s contemptible. Every man—especially
nowadays—ought to pull his weight in the
world. The war’s not over. The real war is only just
beginning. Instead of pulling your weight you think it’s
your right to sit on a cushion, a passenger—or a Pekie
dog—and let other people pull you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes I do. One has to live, and at first we take
any old means to hand. But you’ve been going on at
this for a couple of years and haven’t tried to get out of
it. You like it, Bobby——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loathe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t,” she went on remorselessly, with her newly
acquired knowledge of what a man’s life could be. “All
you loathe is the work—especially when it doesn’t
bring you in as much money as you want. You hate
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resentment gradually growing out of amusement at
his presumptuous proposal had wrought her to a pitch
of virtuous indignation. Here was this young man, of
cultivated manners, intelligent, able-bodied, attractive,
rejecting any kind of mission in existence, and——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Bobby,” she said, rising from her chair
by the tea-table and dominating him with a little gesture,
“don’t get up. You sit there. You’ve asked me to marry
you, because you think I’m rich. Hold your tongue,”
she flashed, as he was about to speak. “I’ll take all the
love and that sort of thing for granted. But if I was
poor you wouldn’t have thought of it. At the back of
your mind you imagine that if I married you, we could
lead a life of Percy’s and the Savoy and Monte Carlo and
the South Sea Islands, and you needn’t do another stroke
of work all your life long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned forward in his chair protesting eagerly that
it wasn’t true. He would marry her to-morrow were she
penniless. She had his salvation soul and body in her
hands. He hungered for work; but the coils of his present
life had a strangle-hold on him. Suddenly he rose
and advanced a step towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Olivia. If you won’t marry me, will you help
me in other ways? I’m desperate. You think you know
something about the world. But you don’t. I’m up
against it. It may mean prison. For the love of God
lend me a couple of hundred pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ugly word prison sent a stab through her heart;
but immediately afterwards the common-sense of her
Gale ancestry told her either that he was lying, or, if it
were true, that he deserved it. She asked coldly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you been doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you,” he said. “You must trust me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t and that is why I can’t lend you two hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You refuse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His soft voice became a snarl and his lip curled unpleasantly
back beneath the little silky moustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how you dare, after all the encouragement
you’ve given me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him aghast. “Encouragement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Didn’t you make me dance attendance on you
at Brighton? Haven’t you brought me here over and
over again? You’ve behaved damnably to me. You’ve
made me waste my time. I’ve turned other women who
would have only been too glad——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In horror, she flew to the door and threw it open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And speeding across the hall she threw open the flat
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” she said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crossed the landing and rang the lift bell and returned
to the hall, where he met her and threw himself on
his knees and looked up at her with wild, hunted eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, Olivia. For God’s sake forgive me. I
was mad. I didn’t know what I was saying. Shut that
door and I’ll tell you everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Olivia passed him by into the sitting-room, and
stood with her back against the door until she heard the
clash of the lift gates and the retreating footsteps of
Bobby Quinton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short while ago she had nearly quarrelled with
Mauregard because, in a wordy dissertation on the
modern young men who lived on women, he instanced
Bobby as possibly coming within the category. Now she
knew that Mauregard was right. She felt sick. Also
deadly ashamed of her superior attitude of well-meant
reprimand. She burned with the consciousness of tongue
in cheek while he listened. Well, that was the end of the
Lydian galley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not recover till the next afternoon, when Triona
called to take her to the Blenkirons’ Sunday intellectual
symposium in Fielder’s Park. She welcomed him impulsively
with both hands outstretched, as a justification
of her faith in mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t tell how glad I am to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you,” said he, kissing first one hand and then
the other, “can’t tell how good I think God is to me.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span><span class='sc'>E</span> brought great news. Not only had his publishers
thought well of the novel and offered
him good terms, including a substantial advance,
but they professed themselves able to place it
serially in England for a goodly sum. They had also
shown him the figures of the half-yearly returns on
American sales of <span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span> which transcended
his dreams of opulence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had forgotten America,” he said naïvely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re nothing, if not original,” she laughed. “That’s
what I like about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He insisted on the wild extravagance of a taxi to the
garden city. All that money he declared had gone to
his head. He felt the glorious intoxication of wealth.
When they were about to turn off the safe highway into
devious garden-city paths, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us change our minds and go straight on to John
o’ Groats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Let us. We’re on the right road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swerved towards her. “Would you? Really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened her bag and took out her purse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got fifteen and sevenpence. How much have
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About three pounds ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed. “This unromantic taxi man would charge
us at least five pounds to take us there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can turn back and fill our pockets at the bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never before realized the blight of the British Sabbath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we’re condemned to Fielder’s Park.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But one of these days we’ll go, you and I together,
to John o’ Groats—as far as we can and then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then we’ll take a ship and sail and sail until we
come to the Fortunate Isles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll let Myra come too?” said Olivia, deliciously
anxious to keep to the playful side of an inevitable road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. We’ll find her a husband. The cabin-boy.
<span class='it'>Pour mousse un chérubin.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when we get to the Fortunate Isles, what should
we do there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall fill our souls with sunlight, so that we could
use it when we came back to our work in this dark and
threatening modern world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s heart leapt at the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go up to John o’ Groats with you whenever you
like,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the taxi, at that moment drawing up before the
detached toy villa, whose “Everdene” painted on the
green garden gate proclaimed the home of the Blenkirons,
inhibited Triona’s reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found within an unbeautiful assemblage of humans
inextricably mingled with crumbling cake and
sloppy cups of tea and cigarette smoke. Agnes, shining
with heat and hospitality, gave them effusive welcome
and, extricating her brother from a distant welter, introduced
him to the newcomers. He was a flabby-faced
young man with a back-thatch of short rufous hair surmounting
a bald forehead. By his ears grew little
patches of side whiskers. He wore an old unbuttoned
Norfolk jacket and a red tie in a soft collar without an
under pin. He greeted them with an enveloping clammy
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So good of you to come, Miss Gale. So glad to meet
you, Mr. Triona. We have heard so much about you.
You will find us here all very earnest in our endeavour to
find a Solution—for never has human problem been so
intricate that a Solution has not been discovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the problem?” asked Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my dear lady, there’s only one. The Way Out—or,
if you have faith—The Way In.” He caught a
lean, thin-bearded man by the arm. “Dawkins, let me
introduce you to Miss Gale. Mr. Dawkins is our <span class='it'>rapporteur</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t any tea,” said Dawkins rebukingly, as
though bidden to a marriage feast she had no wedding
garment. “Come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He frayed her a passage through the chattering swarm
that over-filled the little bow-windowed sitting-room and
provided her with what seemed to be the tepid symbols of
the brotherhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you think of Roger’s article in this week’s
<span class='it'>Signal</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is Roger, and what is <span class='it'>The Signal</span>?” Olivia asked
simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins stared at her for a second and then, deliberately
turning, wormed his path away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s gasp of surprise was followed by a gurgle of
laughter which shook her lifted cup so that it spilled. The
sight of a stained skirt drew from her a sharp exclamation
of dismay. Agnes Blenkiron disengaging herself
from the cluster round the tea-table came to the rescue.
What was the matter? Olivia explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear,” said Agnes, “I ought to have told you.
It’s my fault. Dawkins is such a touchy old thing.
Roger, of course, is my brother—didn’t you know? And
<span class='it'>The Signal</span> is our weekly. Dawkins is the editor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m awfully sorry,” said Olivia, “but ought I to read
<span class='it'>The Signal</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course,” replied Agnes Blenkiron intensely.
“Everybody ought to read it. It’s the only periodical
that matters in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia felt the remorse of those convicted of an unpardonable
crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get a copy to-morrow at the bookstall at Victoria
Station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agnes smiled in her haggard way. “My dear, an organ
like <span class='it'>The Signal</span> doesn’t lie on the bookstalls, like <span class='it'>Comic
Cuts</span> or <span class='it'>The Fortnightly Review</span>. It’s posted to private
subscribers, or it’s given away at meetings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who pays for the printing of it?” asked the practical
Olivia, who had learned from Triona something of the
wild leap in cost of printed matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aubrey Dawkins finds the money. He gets it in the
City. He has given up his heart and soul to <span class='it'>The Signal</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve made an enemy for life,” said Olivia penitently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Blenkiron reassured her. “Oh, no you haven’t.
We haven’t time for enemy making here. Our business is
too important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia in a maze asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my dear child, the Social Revolution. Didn’t
you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She learned many astonishing things that afternoon,
as she was swayed about from introduction to introduction
among the eagerly disputing groups. Hitherto she
had thought, with little comprehension, of the world-spread
social unrest. Strikes angered her because they
interfered with necessary reconstruction and only set the
working classes in a vicious circle chasing high wages
and being chased in their turn by high prices. At other
demands she shuddered, dimly dreading the advent of
Bolshevism. And there she left it. She had imagined
that revolutionary doctrines were preached to factory
hands either secretly by rat-faced agents, or by brass-throated,
bull-necked demagogues. That they should be
accepted as a common faith by a crowd of people much
resembling a fairly well-to-do suburban church congregation
stirred her surprise and even dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how intelligent folk can hold such views,”
she said to Roger Blenkiron, who had been defending
the Russian Soviet system as a philosophic experiment in
government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled indulgently. “Doesn’t the fault lie rather
in you, dear lady, than in the intelligent folk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would that argument stand,” she replied, “if you had
been maintaining that the earth was flat and stood still in
space?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The roundness and motion of the earth are ascertained
physical facts. But—I speak with the greatest
deference—can you assert it to be a scientific fact that a
community of human beings are <span class='it'>a priori</span> incapable of managing
their own affairs on a basis of social equality?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I can,” Olivia declared, to the gentle
amusement of standers-by. “Human nature won’t allow
it. With inequalities of brain and character social equality
is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Lady”—she hated the apostrophe as he said it
and the lift of the eyebrows which caused an upward ripple
that was lost in the far reaches of his bald forehead.
“Dear Lady,” said he, “in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot
you can find every grade of human intellect, from the
inbred young aristocrat who is that much removed”—he
flicked a finger nail—“from a congenital idiot to the acute-brained
statesman; every grade of human character from
the lowest of moral defectives to the highest that the
present civilization can produce. And yet they are all on
a social equality. And why? They started life on a
common plane. The same phenomenon exists in a mass-meeting
of working-men—in any assemblage of human
beings of a particular class who have started life on a
common plane. Now, don’t you see, that if we abolished
all these series of planes and established only one plane,
social equality would be inevitable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how you’re going to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! That’s another question. Think of what the
task is. To make a clean sweep of false principles to
which mankind has subscribed for—what do I know—say—eight
thousand years. It can’t be done in a day. Not
even in a generation. If you wish to render a pestilence-stricken
area habitable, you must destroy and burn for
miles around before you can rebuild. Extend the area
to a country—to the surface of the civilized globe. That’s
the philosophic theory of what is vulgarly called Bolshevism.
Let us lay waste the whole plague-stricken fabric
of our civilization, so that the world may arise, a new
Phœnix, under our children’s hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have put the matter to Miss Gale with your
usual cogency, my dear Roger,” said Dawkins, who had
joined the group. “Perhaps now she may take a less
flippant view of our activities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled, evidently meaning to include the neophyte
in the sphere of his kind indulgence. But Olivia flushed
at the rudeness of his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona who, hidden from Olivia by the standing group,
had been stuffed into a sedentary and penitential corner
with two assertive women and an earnest young Marxian
gasfitter, and had, nevertheless, kept an alert ear on the
neighbouring conversation, suddenly appeared once more
to her rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, sir,” said he, “but to one who has gone
through, as I have done, the Bolshevist horrors which you
advocate so complacently, it’s your view that hardly seems
serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Atrocities, my dear friend,” said the seer-like Dawkins,
“are proverbially exaggerated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a fellow like you mentioned in the Bible,”
retorted Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always admired Didymus for his scientific
mind,” said Dawkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona pulled up his trouser leg and exposed his ankle.
“That’s the mark of fetters. There was a chain and a
twelve pound shot at the end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless you displeased the authorities,” said Dawkins
blandly. “Oh, I’ve read your book, Mr. Triona.
But before judging I should like to hear the other side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid, Mr. Blenkiron,” said Triona, growing
white about the nostrils, to his host who stood by in a detached
sort of manner, with his hands on his hips, “I’ve
unconsciously abused your hospitality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blenkiron protested cheerfully. “Not a bit, my dear
fellow. We pride ourselves on our broad mindedness. If
you preached reactionary Anglicanism here you would be
listened to with respect and interest. On the other hand,
we expect the same consideration to be shown to the
apostles—if you will pardon the word—of our advanced
thought. Your experiences were, beyond doubt, very
terrible. But we admit the necessity of a reign of terror.
We shall have it in this country within the next ten
years. Possibly—probably—all of us here and all the
little gods we cling to will be swept away like the late
Russian aristocracy and <span class='it'>intelligentsia</span>. But suppose we
are all—Dawkins, my sister, and myself—prepared to
suffer martyrdom for the sake of humanity, what would
you have to say against us? Nay—you can be quite
frank. Words cannot hurt us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say you ought to be tied up in Bedlam,”
said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you agree with that, Miss Gale?” said Roger
Blenkiron, turning on her suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reflected for a moment. Then she replied: “If
you can prove beyond question that in fifty years’ time
you will create a more beautiful world, there’s something
in your theories. If you can’t, you all ought to be shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed and held out his hand. “That’s straight
from the shoulder. That’s what we like to hear. Shake
hands on it.” He drew a little book from his pocket and
scribbled a memorandum. “You’re on the free-list of
<span class='it'>The Signal</span>. I think Agnes has your address. You’ll
find in it overwhelming proof. Perhaps, Mr. Triona, too,
would like——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Triona shook his head. “As a technical alien perhaps
it would be inadvisable for me to be in receipt of
revolutionary literature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite understand,” smiled Blenkiron, returning the
book to his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawkins melted away. Other guests took leave of
their host. Triona and Olivia, making a suffocating
course towards the door, were checked by Agnes Blenkiron
who was eager to introduce them to Tom Pyefinch
who, during the war had suffered, at the hands of a capitalist
government, the tortures of the hero too brave to
fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no,” cried Olivia horrified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agnes did not hear. But Pyefinch, a pallid young
man with a scrubby black moustache, was too greatly occupied
with his immediate circle to catch his hostess’s eye.
From his profane lips Olivia learned that patriotism was
the most blatant of superstitions: that the attitude of the
fly preening itself over its cesspool was that of the depraved
and mindless being who could take pride in being
an Englishman. He was not peculiarly hard on England.
All other countries were the mere sewerages of the nationalities
that inhabited them. The high ideals supposed
to crystallize a nation’s life were but factitious and
illusory, propagated by poets and other decadents in the
pay of capitalists: in reality, patriotism only meant the
common cause of the peoples floundering each in its separate
sewer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mere rats, he declared, changing his metaphor. That
was why he and every other intelligent man in the country
refused to join in the rat fight which was the late war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia clutched Triona’s arm. “For God’s sake, Alexis,
let us get out of this. It makes me sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew deep breaths when they escaped into the
fresh air. To Olivia, the little overcrowded drawing-room,
deafening with loud voices, sour with the smell
of milky tea and Virginian tobacco, reeking almost physically
with the madness of anarchy, seemed a miniature
of the bottomless pit. The irony of the man’s talk—the
need to purify by flame a plague-stricken area! God once
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Why did He not blast
with fire from heaven this House of Pestilence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexis Triona laughed sympathetically at her outburst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I confess they’re rather trying,” he remarked.
“Whenever you hear English people say they belong to
the <span class='it'>intelligentsia</span>, you may be sure they’re frightened at
common sense as not being intellectual enough. Blenkiron
and Dawkins are fools of the first water; but Pyefinch
is dangerous. I am afraid I lost my temper,” he
added after a few steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were splendid,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than ever did he seem the one clear-brained,
purposeful man of her acquaintance in the confused
London world. Rapidly she passed them in review as
she walked. Of the others Mauregard was the best; but
he was spending his life on fribbles, his highest heaven
being a smile on the lips of a depraved dancing-woman.
Then, Sydney Rooke, Mavenna, and, even worse now
than Mavenna, the unspeakable Bobby Quinton. So
much for the Lydian set of professed materialists and
pleasure-seekers. In accepting Agnes Blenkiron’s invitation
she had pleasurable anticipation of entering a sphere
of earnest thinkers and social workers who might guide
her stumbling footsteps into the path of duty to herself
and her kind. And to her dismay she had met Dawkins
and Blenkiron and Pyefinch, earnest, indeed, in their
sophistry and mad in their theories of destruction. Her
brain was in a whirl with the doctrines to which she had
listened. She felt terrified at she knew not what. Even
Lydia’s cynical world was better than this. Yet between
these two extremes there must be a world of high endeavour,
of science, art, philanthropy, thought; that in
which, she vaguely imagined, Blaise Olifant must have
his being; even that of the women at the club dinner.
But her mind shook off women as alien to its subconscious
argument. In this conjectural London world one man
alone stood out typical—the man striding loosely by her
side. A young careless angel, he had delivered her from
Mavenna. A man, he had exorcised her horror of Bobby
Quinton. And now, once more, she saw him, in her girlish
fancy, a heroic figure, sane, calm, and scornful, facing
a horde of madmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked, occasionally losing their way and being
put on it by chance encounters, through the maze of new
and distressingly decorous avenues, some finished, others
petering out, after a few houses, into placarded building
lots or waste land; a wilderness not of the smug villa-dom
of old-established suburbs, but of a queer bungalow-dom
assertive, in its distinctive architecture, of unreal
pursuit of Aspirations in capital letters. Most of the
avenues abutted on a main street of shops with pseudo-artistic
frontages giving the impression that the inhabitants
of the City could only be induced to satisfy the
vulgar needs of their bodies by the lure of the æsthetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let us judge our late friends too harshly,” said
Triona waving an arm. “All this is the Land of Self-Consciousness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they made their way through the solider, stolider
fringes of the main road, and emerged on the great
thoroughfare itself, wide and unbusied on this late summer
Sunday afternoon. Prosaically they lingered, waiting
for an infrequent omnibus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank goodness, we’re out of the Land of Self-Consciousness,”
said Olivia. “The Great North Road is
too big a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes met in a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t forget your love of big things,” said he. “It’s
inspiring. Yes. It’s a big thing. And it doesn’t really
begin in London. It starts from Land’s End—and it goes
on and on through the heart of England and through
the heart of Scotland carrying two nations’ history on its
flanks, caring for nothing but its appointed task, until
it sighs at John o’ Groats and says: ‘My duty’s done.’
There’s nothing that stirs one’s imagination more than a
great road or a great river. Somehow I prefer the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re nearer to it because it was made by man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How our minds work together!” he cried admiringly
“I only have to say half a thing and you complete it.
More than that—you give my meaningless ideas meaning.
Yes. God’s works are great. But we can’t measure
them. We have no scale for God, But we have for
Man, and so Man’s big works thrill us and compel us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What big thing could we do?” asked Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean humanity—or you and I together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two human beings thinking alike, and free and
honest.” Instinctively she took his arm and her step
danced in time with his. “Oh, you don’t know how good
it is to feel real. Let us do something big in the world.
What can we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can help me to the very biggest thing in all the
universe—for me,” he cried, pressing her arm tight against
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her pulses throbbed. She knew that further argument
on her part would be but exquisite playing with words.
The hour which, in her maidenly uncertainty she had
dreaded, had now come, and all fear had passed away.
Yes; now she was real; now she was certain that her
love was real. Real man, real woman. Her heart leaped
to him with almost the shock of physical pain. Again in
a flash she swept the Lydian and the Blenkiron firmament
and exulted. Yet in her happiness she said with
very foolish and with very feminine guile:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my dear Alexis, that’s what I’ve longed for. If
only I could be of some little help to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help?” He laughed shortly and halted and swung
her round. “Have you ever tried to think what you are
to me? Would you like me to tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She disengaged herself and walked delicately on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may pass the time till the bus comes,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to tell her. And three minutes afterwards
the noisy, infrequent motor-bus passed them by, unheeded
and even unperceived.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span><span class='sc'>OMEWHERE</span> on the South Coast, screened from
the vulgar by the trap of a huge watering-place, is
a long, thin, sandy promontory sticking out to
sea, like an innocent rib of wilderness. Here there is no
fun of the fair, because there is no fair to provide the
fun. There are no taverns, no boarding-houses, no lodgings.
One exclusive little hotel rules the extreme tip
of the tongue of land in consort with the miniature jetty
and quay by which, in late exciting times, strange craft
were moored, flying the white ensign and hoar with
North Sea brine and deadly secrets. The rest of the
spit is peppered with a score of little shy houses, each
trying to hide itself from its neighbours, in the privacy
of its own sandpit. If your house is on the more desirable
side of it, you can look out over the vastness of
the sea with the exhilarating certainty (if your temperament
may thereby be exhilarated) that there is nothing
but blue water between you and the coast of Africa.
If your house is, less fortunately, on the other side, your
view commands a spacious isle-studded harbour fringed
by distant blue and mysterious hills. But it is given to
any one to walk out of the back of his little hermitage,
and, standing in the dividing road, to enjoy, in half a minute,
both aspects at once. It is called esoterically by
its frequenters “the Point,” so that the profane, map-searching,
may not discover its whereabouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just high enough to be under the lee of a sand-hill, with
its front windows and veranda staring at the African
coast, some thousand miles away, stood the tiniest, most
fragile and most absurd of the habitations. Its name was
“Quien Sabe,” suggestive of an imaginative abandonment
of search after nomenclature by the original proprietor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A house called ‘Quien Sabe’——” said Alexis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the house for us,” cried Olivia, aglow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took it at once, without question. It wasn’t as
if it were an uncertain sort of place, like “Normanhurst,”
or “Sea View.” The name proclaimed frankly the certainty
of venturesomeness. And Alexis Triona, sitting on
the scrubby grass and sand, his back against the little
veranda, the infinite sea and all the universe enveloped
in still moonlight, laughed the laugh of deep happiness
at their childish inspiration. He rolled, licked and lit
the final cigarette. Tobacco was good. Better was this
August night of velvet and diamonds. Below, the little
stone groin shone like onyx. The lazy surf of ebb-tide
far away on the sand of a tiny bay glimmered like the
foam in fairyland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only half the man’s consciousness allowed itself to be
drenched with the beauty of the night. The other half
remained alert to a voice, to a summons, to something
more rare and exquisite than the silver air and murmuring
sea and the shine of all the stars. A few minutes before,
languorous by his side, she had been part and parcel of it
all. The retreating ripple of wave had melted into the
softness of her voice. Her laughing eyes had gleamed
importance in the stellar system. The sweet throb of her
body, as she had reclined, his arm about her, was rhythmic
with the pulsation of the night. And now she had gone;
gone just for a few moments; gone just for a few moments
until she would divinely break the silence by the
little staccato cry of his name; but, nevertheless, her
transitory severance had robbed this outer world of half
its beauty. He had consciously to incorporate her in
order to give meaning to this wonder of amethyst and
aquamarine and onyx and diamond and pearl and velvet
and the infinite message of the immensities coming through
the friendly silence of the moon.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>They had been married all of a sudden, both caught up
on the wings of adventure. They were young, free as
air. Why should they wait? They kept it secret, a
pair of romantics. Only Blaise Olifant, summoned from
Medlow, and Janet Philimore were admitted into the
conspiracy, and attended the wedding. At first Olivia
had twinges of conscience. As a well-conducted young
woman she ought to ask her old friend, Mr. Trivett, to
stand <span class='it'>in loco parentis</span> and give her away. But then there
would be Mrs. Trivett and the girls to reckon with. Mr.
Fenmarch, left out, might take offence. The news, too,
would run through every Medlow parlour. Old John
Freke, in his weekly letter to Lydia, would be sure to allude
to the matter; and it was Lydia and the galley that
she most desired to keep in ignorance. So they were married,
by special licence, at the church in Ashley Place, one
quiet, sunny morning, in the presence of Myra and the
two witnesses they had convened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they emerged into the sunshine after the ceremony,
Olifant said to her:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never been so reluctant to give anything away
in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked a laughing “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dog in the manger, I suppose.” He smiled whimsically.
“I shall feel more of a bachelor than ever when I
get back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t, unless you like.” She motioned slightly
with her head towards Janet, talking to Alexis, a few feet
away. “I’ve not been too busy to think of matchmaking.
She’s the dearest of girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not my landlady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her happy laughter rippled forth, calling the others
near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wants a law forbidding the marriage of landladies.
But think of the advantage. Now you can have your
landlady to stay with you—in strict propriety—if you
will ask us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We settled that with Alexis last night,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three taxis were waiting. One for the bride and
bridegroom. One, already piled with luggage, for Myra
who after being fervently kissed in the vestry by Olivia,
had said by way of congratulation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dearie, it’s better than being married in a Registry
Office,” and had gone forth unemotionally to see that
the trunks were still there. And one for Olifant and
Janet. They drove to the station, to the train which
was to take them on their way to the home which in
their romanticism they had never troubled to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure it’s all right,” said Janet, who had been responsible
for their taking “Quien Sabe.” “Father and
I’ll be at The Point in a fortnight. If you don’t want to
see us, tie a white satin bow on the gate and we won’t
mind a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For General Philimore was the happy owner of one
of the little hermitages on The Point, and like a foolish
old soldier lived there in holiday times, instead of letting
it for the few summer weeks at the yearly rental of his
London flat; so that Janet assumed the airs of an authority
on The Point, and wrote stern uncompromising
business letters to agents threatening them with the displeasure
of the daughter of a Major-General, if a “Quien
Sabe” swept, garnished, and perfectly appointed, with a
charwoman, ditto, in attendance, did not receive the
bridal pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a palace, Mr. Triona,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has it to do with me?” he answered. “A dream
nest in a cliff for this bird wife of mine is all I ask for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s eyes smiled on him. Why was he so different
from the rest of men—even from so fine a type as Blaise
Olifant? She appraised them swiftly. The soldier had
not yet been sunk into the scholar. He stood erect, clean
built, wearing his perfectly fitting grey suit like uniform,
his armless sleeve pinned across his chest, his lip still
bearing the smart little military moustache, his soft grey
hat at ever so slightly a swaggering angle on his neatly
cropped head. A distinguished figure, to which his long
straight nose added a curious note of distinction and
individuality. But all that he was you saw in a glance:
the gentleman, the soldier, the man of intellect. On the
other hand, there stood the marvellous man that was
her husband, hiding behind the drawn boyish face God
knew what memories of pain heroically conquered and
God knew what visions of genius. Although he had gone
to a good tailor for his blue serge suit—she had accompanied
him—he had the air of wearing clothes as a concession
of convention. The lithe frame beneath seemed
to be impatient of their restraint. They fitted in an easy
sort of way, but were dominated by his nervous eager
personality. One flash of a smile illuminating eyes and
thin face, one flashing gesture of hand or arm, and for
ought any one knew or cared, he might be dressed in chain
armour or dungaree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little speech pleased her. She slipped her hand
through the crook of his arm in the pride of possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever hear such an undomesticated pronouncement?”
she laughed. “We’re going to change all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the train carried them off to the great wonder and
change of their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train out of sight, Blaise Olifant stuck in his pocket
the handkerchief he had been waving, and turned with a
sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she’ll be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t she?” asked Janet Philimore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a bright-cheeked, brown-eyed, brown-haired
girl, with a matter-of-fact manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know of no reason,” he replied. “I was expressing
a hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her to her homeward-bound omnibus and
walked, somewhat moodily, on his road. After a day
or two, the pleasures of London proving savourless, he
returned to Medlow. But “The Towers” no longer
seemed quite the same. He could not tell why. The
house had lost fragrance.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the pair had gone to the little toy home
whose questioning name pointed to mystery. There were
just three rooms in it, all opening on to a veranda full
in sight (save for the configuration of the globe) of the
African coast. On this veranda, sitting back, they lost
sight of the whin-grown slope and the miniature sandy
cove beneath; and their world was but a welter of sea,
and its inhabitants but a few gulls, sweeping and swirling
past them with a shy friendliness in their yellow
eyes. In a dip of the sand-hill, just behind this elementary
dwelling and communicating with it by a short covered
way, stretched an old railway carriage divided into
kitchen, pantry, bathroom, and bunks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the craziest place I’ve ever seen,” said Myra.
“People will be living in old aeroplanes next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the very craziness of the habitation made for their
selfish joy. The universe, just for these twain, had gone
joyously mad. A cocky little villa made to the model of
a million others would have defeated the universe’s benign
intention. Nothing could be nearer to Triona’s
dream nest in a cliff. Their first half-hour’s exploring,
hand in hand, was that of children let loose in a fairy
tale castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s only one egg-cup,” croaked Myra, surveying
an exiguous row of crockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many more do we want?” cried Olivia. “We can
only eat one egg at a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed out and stood on the edge of their small
domain, surveying the sandy beach and the seaweed and
shell-encrusted groin and the limitless sea, and breathed
in the soft salt wind of all the heavens sweeping through
their hair and garments, and he put his arm around her
and kissed her—and he laughed and said, looking into
her eyes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweetheart, Heaven is empty and all the angels are
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On sunny days they lived in the sea, drying themselves
on their undisturbed half-moon of beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you learn to swim?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated for a second, casting at her one of his
swift, half furtive glances. Then he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Volga.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “You’re always romantic. I learned at
commonplace Llandudno.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s your sense of relativity, beloved?” said he.
“In Central Russia one regards the coast of Wales as
fantastic fairyland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, you can go to Llandudno to-morrow, if you like—taking
me with you, of course; but I shall never swim
in the Volga, or the Caspian Sea, or Lake Baikal, or any
of those places with names that have haunted me since I
was a little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of these days we’ll go—it may be some years,
but eventually Russia must have a settled Government—and
we’ll still be young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun and the hot sand on which she lay, adorable in
deep red bathing kit and cap, warmed her through and
through, flooding her with the sense of physical well-being.
It was impossible that she should ever grow old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s something to look forward to,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes they hired a boat and sailed and fished.
She admired his handiness and knowledge and prescience
of the weather. Once, as the result of their fishing, they
brought in a basket of bass and gar-fish, the latter a
strange, dainty silver beast with the body of an eel and
the tail of a trout and the beak of a woodcock, and in high
spirits they usurped Myra’s railway-compartment kitchen,
while he fried the catch for lunch. Olivia marvelled at
his mastery. In spite of her sage and deliberate putting
aside of the rose-coloured glasses of infatuation, in whatever
aspect she viewed him, he stood supreme. From the
weaving of high romance to the cooking of fish—the
whole gamut of human activities—there was nothing in
which he did not excel. Her trust in him was infinite.
She lost herself in happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took some days to arouse her to a sense of the outer
world. A letter from Lydia reminded her of her friend’s
pleasant ignorance. With the malice of the unregenerate
feminine, she wrote: “I’m so sorry I can’t be bridesmaid
as you had arranged. How can I, seeing that I am
married myself? It happened all in a hurry, as the
beautiful things in life do. The fuss of publicity would
have spoilt it. That’s why we told nobody. This is
much better than Dinard”—Sydney Rooke’s selection for
the honeymoon. “I haven’t worn a hat since I’ve been
here, and my way of dressing for dinner is to put on
a pair of stockings; sometimes a mackintosh, for we
love to dine on the veranda when it rains. It rained
so hard last night that we had to fix up an umbrella
to the ceiling like a chandelier to catch the water coming
through the roof. So you will see that Alexis and I are
perfectly happy. By the way, I’ve not told you what my
name is. It is Mrs. Triona.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And so on and so on
at the dictate of her dancing gladness, freakishly picturing
Lydia’s looks of surprise, distaste, and reprobation as
she read the letter. Yet she finished graciously, acknowledging
Lydia’s thousand kindnesses, for according to her
lights Lydia had done her best to put her on the only path
that could be trod by comely and well-dressed woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sealed up her letter and, coming out on to the veranda
where Alexis was correcting the proofs of an article,
told him all about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think we ought to please Lydia and go to
Dinard and wear wonderful clothes, and mix with fashionable
folk, and have expensive meals and gamble in the
Casino, and dance and do our duty as self-respecting
people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have but to change yourself into whatever fairy
thing you like, my princess,” said he, “and I will follow
you. Where you are, the world is. Where you are not,
there is the blankness of before creation.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting that night, with his back against the veranda, he
thought of this speech of the afternoon. Formulated a
bit self-consciously, it was nevertheless true. The
landscape, no matter what it was, existed merely as a
setting for her. Even in this jewelled wonder of moonlit
sea and sky there was the gap of the central gem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rolled and lit another cigarette—this time, surely,
the very last. Why she took so long to disrobe, he never
strove to conjecture. Her exquisite feminine distance
from him was a conception too tremulous to be gripped
with a rough hand and brutally examined. That was the
lure and the delight of her, mystical, paradoxical—he
could define it only vaguely as the nearness of her set
in a far-off mystery. At once she was concrete and
strong as the sea, and as elusive as the Will-o’-the-Wisp of
his dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the imaginative lover; the man who, by imagining
fantasies to be real, had made them real; who, grasping
realities, had woven round them the poet’s fantasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And meanwhile Olivia, secure in her happiness, kept
him waiting and dreaming because she had made a romantic
vow to record, before going to sleep, each day’s precious
happenings in a diary which she kept under lock
and key in her dressing-case. She wrote sitting up in bed,
and now and then she sniffed and smiled as the soft air
came through the open window laden with the perfume of
the cigarette.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>N</span> the course of time, Janet Philimore and her attendant
father, the General, arrived at their house
on The Point, and as Olivia, apprised of their
advent, did not tie a white satin bow on her gate, General
and Miss Philimore left cards on the newly wedded
couple, or, more exactly, a pencilled leaf torn out of a
notebook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus arose a little intimacy which Olivia encouraged
on Alexis’s account. Had not her father and brothers
trained her in the ways of men, one of which vital ways
was that which led to the social intercourse of man with
man? Besides, it was a law of sex. If she had not a
woman to talk to, she declared, she would go crazy. It
was much more comforting to powder one’s nose in the
privacy of the gynæceum than beneath man’s unsympathetic
stare. Conversely it had been a dictum of her
father’s that, in order to enjoy port, men must be released
from the distracting chatter of women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’m not broad-minded, I’m nothing,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Broad’ is inadequate,” replied her husband, thrusting
back his brown hair. “The very wonder of you is
that your mind is as wide as the infinite air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which, of course, was as pleasant a piece of information
as any bride could receive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The magic of the halcyon days was intensified by the
satisfaction of the sex cravings which, by the symbolism
of nose-powdering and port-drinking, Olivia had enunciated.
In the deeps of her soul she could find no consuming
passion for sitting scorched in a boat with a
baited and contemptuously disregarded line between expectant
finger and thumb. She could not really understand
the men’s anxiety to induce a mentally defective
fish to make a fool of itself. Yet she would have sat
blissfully for hours at his bidding, for the mere joy of
doing as she was bidden; but not to be bidden was a great
relief. Similarly, Alexis could not vie with Olivia in
concentration of being over the selection of material (in
the fly-trap of a great watering-place previously mentioned)
and over the pattern and the manufacture by
knitting of gaudy hued silk jumpers. His infatuated eye
marvelled at the delicate swiftness of her fingers, at the
magical development of the web that was to encase her
adorable body. But his heart wasn’t in it. Janet’s was.
And General Philimore brought to the hooking of bass
the earnest singleness of purpose that, vague years ago,
had enabled him to ensnare thousands of Huns in barbed-wire
netting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The primitive laws of sex asserted themselves, to the
common happiness. The men fished; the women fashioned
garments out of raw material. We can’t get away
from the essentials of the Stone Age. And why in the
world should we?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But—and here comes the delight of the reactions of
civilization—invariably the last quarter of an hour of
these exclusive sex-communings was filled with boredom
and impatience. Alone at last, they would throw themselves
into each other’s arms with unconscionable gracelessness
and say: “Thank Heaven, they’ve gone!” And
then the sun would shine more brightly and the lap of the
waves around them would add buoyancy to their bodies,
and Myra, ministering to their table wants, would assume
the guise of a high priestess consecrating their intimacy,
and the moon would invest herself with a special splendour
in their honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and then the four came together; a picnic lunch
at some spot across the bay; a wet after-dinner rubber at
bridge, or an hour’s gossip of old forgotten far-off things
and battles of the day before yesterday, or—in the
General’s house—a little idle music. There it was that
Olivia discovered another accomplishment in her wonderful
husband. He could play, sensitively, by ear—knowledge
of notated music he disclaimed. Having been
impressed as a child with the idea that playing from ear
was a sin against the holy spirit of musical instruction,
and gaining from such instruction (at Landsdowne House—how
different if she had been trained in the higher
spheres of Blair Park!) merely a distaste for mechanical
fingering of printed notes, she had given up music with a
sigh of relief, mingled with regret, and had remained unmusical.
And here was Alexis, who boasted his ignorance
of the difference between a crotchet and an arpeggio,
racking the air with the poignant melancholy of
Russian folk-songs, and, in a Puckish twinkle, setting
their pulses dancing with a mad modern rhythm of African
savagery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, dear, what else can you do?” she asked, after the
first exhibition of this unsuspected gift. “Tell me; for
these shocks aren’t good for my health.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the mouth-organ,” he laughed, “I’ve not met any
one to touch me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not idle boasting. On their next rainy-day visit
to the neighbouring town, Olivia slipped into a toy shop
and bought the most swollenly splendid of these instruments
that she could find, and Alexis played “The Marseillaise”
upon it with all the blare of a steam orchestrion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy days sped by in an atmosphere of love and
laughter, yet filled not only with the sweet doings of idleness.
Olivia discovered that the poet-artist must work,
impelled thereto by his poet-artistry. He must write of
the passing things which touched his imagination and
which his imagination, in turn, transmuted into impressions
of beauty. These were like a painter’s sketches,
said he, for use in after-time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s for you, my dear, that I am making a hoard of
our golden moments, so that one of these days I may lay
them all at your feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he must read, too. During the years that the
locust of war had eaten, his educational development had
stood still. His English literary equipment fell far short
of that required by a successful English man of letters.
Vast tracts of the most glorious literature in the world
he had as yet left unexplored. The great Elizabethan
dramatists, for instance. Thick, serious volumes from the
London Library strewed the furniture of the wind-swept
sitting-room. Olivia, caught by his enthusiasm and
proud to identify herself with him in this feeding of the
fires of his genius, read with him; and to them together
were revealed the clanging majesty of Marlowe, the
subtle beauty of Beaumont and Fletcher, the haunting
gloom of Webster. In the evenings they would sit, lover-like,
the book between them, and read aloud, taking parts;
and it never failed to be an astonishment and a thrill to
the girl when, declaiming a fervid passage, he seemed for
the moment to forget her and to live in the sense of the
burning words. It was her joy to force her emotion to
his pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, reading Beaumont and Fletcher’s <span class='it'>Philaster</span>, he
clutched her tightly with his left arm, while his right
hand upstretched, invoked unheeding Heaven, and declaimed:</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“And then have taken me some mountain girl,</p>
<p class='line0'>Beaten with winds, chaste as the hardened rocks</p>
<p class='line0'>Whereon she dwells; that might have strewn my bed</p>
<p class='line0'>With leaves and reeds, and with the skins o’ Beasts,</p>
<p class='line0'>Our neighbours; and have borne at her big breasts</p>
<p class='line0'>My large coarse issue! This had been a life</p>
<p class='line0'>Free from vexation.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“But, Alexis, darling, I’m so sorry,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it as if you meant it, as if it was the desire of
your heart. I’m not a bit like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They laughed and kissed. A dainty interlude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve never really felt like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The idea isn’t even new,” exclaimed Olivia, with grand
inversion of chronology. “Tennyson has something like
it in <span class='it'>Locksley Hall</span>. How does it go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a wrinkling of the brow she quoted:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>“Iron-jointed, supple-sinewed, they shall dive and they shall run,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he did!” cried Triona. “How wonderful of you to
remember! Why—the dear beautiful old thief!” He
forgot the point at issue in contemplation of the literary
coincidence of plagiarism. “Well, I’m damned! Such
a crib! With the early Victorian veil of prudery over it!
Oh, Lord! Give me the Elizabethan, any day. Yet,
isn’t it funny? The period-spirit? If Tennyson had
been an Elizabethan, he would have walked over Beaumont
and Fletcher like a Colossus; but in a world under
the awe of Queen Victoria’s red flannel petticoat he is
reduced to stealing Elizabethan thunder and reproducing
it with a bit of sheet iron and a stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear,” said Olivia, “we have much to be thankful
for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our generation. We live in the sun. No longer
under the shadow of the red flannel petticoat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rapturously he called her a marvel among women.
Olivia’s common sense discounted the hyperbole; but she
loved his tribute to her sally of wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book slipped to the floor, while she began an argument
on the morality of plagiarism. How far was a man
justified in stealing another man’s idea, working up another
man’s material?</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sudden and excited defence of the plagiarist surprised
her. He rose, strode about the room and, talking,
grew eloquent; quoted Shakespeare as the great exemplar
of the artist who took his goods from everywhere he
found them. Olivia, knowing his joy in conversational
fence, made smiling attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the last three hundred years we have developed a
literary conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A commercial matter,” he declared. “A question of
copyright. I granted that. You have no right to exploit
another man’s ideas to his material loss. But take
a case like this”—he paced before her for a few seconds—“on
the spur of the moment. It must have happened
a thousand times in the War. An unknown dead man
just a kilometre away from a bleak expanse of waste
covered with thousands of dead men. Some one happens
upon him. Searches him for identification. Finds nothing
of any use or interest save a little notebook with
leaves of the thinnest paper next his skin. And he
glances through the book and sees at once that it is no
ordinary diary of war—discomfort of billets, so many
miles’ march, morale of the men and so forth—but something
quite different. He puts it in his pocket. For all
that the modern world is concerned, the dead man is as
lost as any skeleton dug up in an ancient Egyptian grave-yard.
The living man, when he has leisure, reads the
closely written manuscript book, finds it contains rough
notes of wonderful experiences, thoughts, imaginings.
But all in a jumble, ill expressed, chaotic. Suppose, now,
the finder, a man with the story-teller’s gift, weaves a
wonderful thrilling tale out of this material. Who is
injured? Nobody. On the contrary, the world is the
richer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he were honest, he ought to tell the truth in a
preface,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona laughed. “Who would believe him? The
trick of writing false prefaces in order to give verisimilitude
is so overworked that people won’t believe the genuine
ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that’s so,” she acquiesced. Her interest in
the argument was only a reflection of his. She was far
more eager to resume the interrupted reading of <span class='it'>Philaster</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s lovely that we always see things in the same way,”
said he, sitting down again by her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides all this delightful work and play there was the
practical future to be considered. They could not live
for ever at “Quien Sabe” on The Point, nor could they
live at the Lord knows where anywhere else. They must
have a home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before you stole over my being and metamorphosed
me, I should have asked—why?” he said. “Any old dry
hole in a tree would have done for me, until I got tired of
it and flew to another. But now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’re dying to live in a nice little house and
have your meals regular and pay rates and taxes, and
make me a respectable woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They decided that a house was essential. It would
have to be furnished. But what was the object of buying
new furniture at the present fantastic prices when she
had a great house full of it—from real Chippendale chairs
to sound fish-kettles? The answer was obvious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not Medlow? Olifant won’t stay there for
ever. He hinted as much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. No. Medlow was excellent for
cabbages, but passion-flowers like her Alexis would wilt
and die. He besought her with laughing tenderness not
to think of him. From her would he drink in far more
sunlight and warmth than his passion-flower-like nature
could need. Had she not often told him of her love for
the quaint old house and its sacred associations? It
would be a joy to him to see her link up the old life with
the new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” he urged, attributing her reluctance to
solicitude for his happiness, “it’s the common-sense solution.
There’s our natural headquarters. We needn’t
stay there all the year round, from year’s end to year’s
end. When we want to throw a leg we can run away, to
London, Paris, “Quien Sabe,” John o’ Groats—the wide
world’s before us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Olivia kept on shaking her head. Abandoning
metaphor, she insisted on the necessity of his taking the
position he had gained in the social world of art and
letters. Hadn’t he declared a day or two ago that good
talk was one of the most stimulating pleasures in life?
What kind of talk could Medlow provide? It was far
more sensible, when Major Olifant’s tenancy was over,
to move the furniture to their new habitation and let
“The Towers” unfurnished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you will, belovedest,” he said. “Yet,” he added,
with a curious note of wistfulness, “I learned to love the
house and the sleepy old town and the mouldering castle.”
The practical decision to which she was brought out of
honeymoon lotus-land was the first cloud on her married
happiness. It had never occurred to her before that
she could have anything to conceal from her husband.
Not an incident in the Lydian galley had her ingenuousness
not revealed. But now she felt consciously disingenuous,
and it was horrible. How could she confess
the real reason for her refusal to live in Medlow? Was
she not to him the Fairy Princess? He had told her so
a thousand times. He had pictured his first vision of her
glowing flame colour and dusk beneath the theatre portico,
his other vision of her exquisite in moonlight and snowflake
in the great silent street. His faith in her based
itself on the axiom of her regality. Woman-like, she had
laughed within herself at his dear illusions. But that
was the key of the staggering position; his illusions were
inexpressibly dear to her; they were the priceless jewels
of her love. With just a little craft, so sweet, so divinely
humorous, to exercise she could maintain these illusions
to the end of time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not at Medlow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had gone forth from it, on her pilgrimage, in order
to establish herself in her mother’s caste. And she had
succeeded. The name of her grandfather, Bagshawe of
the Guides, had been a password to the friendships which
now she most valued. Marriage had defined her social
ambitions. They were modest, fundamentally sane.
Her husband, a man of old family and gentle upbringing,
ranked with her mother and General and Janet Philimore.
He was a man of genius, too, and his place was among
the great ones of the social firmament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought solely in terms of caste, gentle and intellectual.
She swept aside the meretricious accessories of the
Sydney Rooke gang with a reactionary horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days before, Alexis, lyrically lover like, had said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are so beautiful. If only I could string your neck
with pearls, and build you a great palace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” etcetera,
etcetera, etcetera, in the manner of the adoring, but comparatively
impecunious poet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she had replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want pearls, palaces or motor-cars. They’re
all symbols, my dear, of the Unreal. Ordinary comfort
of food and warmth and decent clothes—yes. But that’s
all. So long as you string my heart with love—and my
mind with noble thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She longed passionately to live with him, above herself.
And yet, here at the outset, was she living below herself.
She would wake in the morning and, sleepless, grow hot
and clammy at the thought of her deception. And the
whole of her Medlow life drifted miserably through her
consciousness: the schoolgirl’s bitter resentment of the
supercilious nose in the air attitude of the passing
crocodile of Blair Park; of the vicar’s daughters’ condescending
nod—he was a Canon of somewhere and an
“Honourable” to boot—at “that pretty Miss Gale”; her
recognition, when she came to years of sense, of the social
gulf between her family and the neighbouring gentry
whose lives, with their tennis parties and dances and
social doings, seemed so desirable and so remote. To
bring her wonderful husband into that world of “homely
folk,” the excellent, but uncultivated Trivetts, the more
important tradespeople, the managers of the mills, the
masters of the County School, her father’s world, and to
see him rigidly excluded from that to which her mother
and he himself belonged, was more than she could bear.
She tortured herself with the new problem of snobbery—rating
herself, in this respect, beneath Lydia, who was
frankly cynical as to both her own antecedents and her
late husband’s social standing. But for the life of her she
could not bring herself to explain to Alexis the real impossibility
of Medlow. When she tried, she found that
his foreign upbringing failed to seize the fine shade of her
suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His gay carelessness eventually lulled her conscience.
As soon as Olifant had done with “The Towers,” they
could transfer the furniture to whatever habitation they
chose and let the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel you couldn’t find it in your heart to sell the old
place,” he said. “Besides—who knows—one of these
days——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought him the most delicately perceptive of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear,” she said, her cheek against his. “I couldn’t
sell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all Medlow danger was over. She breathed
freely. But still—the little cloud of deceit hung over her
serene mind and cast ever so tiny a shadow over her
rapturous life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been four weeks in the deliciously sure uncertainty
of “Quien Sabe,” when, one noon while they were
drying themselves in the hot sand and sunshine of their
tiny bay, after a swim, Myra came down gaunt through
the whin-covered hill-side with a telegram in her hand.
With the perversity of her non-recognition of the household
paramountcy of her master, she handed the envelope
to Olivia. The name was just “Triona.” Olivia was
about to open it instinctively when Alexis started to a
sitting position, and, with an eager glance, held out his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s for me. I was expecting it. Do you
mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She passed it over with a smile. Alexis rose to his
feet, tore the envelope open, and moving a few yards away
towards the surf read the message. Then slowly he tore
it up into the tiniest fragments and scattered them on the
last wavelets of the ebb tide, and stood for a second or two,
staring across the sea. At last he turned. Olivia rose to
meet him. Myra was impassively making her way back
up the rough slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Olivia, puzzled at his
scrupulous destruction of the telegram and reading something
like fear in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had bad news,” he said. He picked up his bath-gown,
shook it free from sand, and huddled it around him.
“Let us get up to the house.” He shivered. “It’s cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She followed him wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What bad news?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his head, with a half-laugh. “Nothing so
very desperate. The end of the world hasn’t come yet.
I’ll tell you when I’ve changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rushed up the steps of the veranda and into his
little dressing-room. Olivia, dry and warm, sat in a sun-beat
chair and anxiously waited for him. The instinct of
a loving woman, the delicacy of a sensitive soul, forbade
her teasing with insistent questions a man thrown for
the moment off his balance. Yet she swept the horizon of
her mind for reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quarter of an hour afterwards—it had seemed a
quarter of a century—he appeared, dressed, not in his
customary flannels, but in the blue serge suit of their
wedding day. The sight of it struck a chill through her
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “Yes, my dear, I have to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? What has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you, dear. That’s the heart-rending part
of it. It’s secret—from the Foreign Office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reacted in laughter. “Oh, my darling—how you
frightened me. I thought it was something serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it’s serious, if I have to leave you for three
or four days—perhaps a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A week!” She stood aghast. It was serious. How
could she face a lonely epoch of seven days, each counting
twenty-four thousand halting hours? What did it
mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are not many men who know Russian as I do.
I’ve been in touch with the Intelligence Department ever
since I landed in England. That’s why I went to Finland
in the autumn. These things bind me to inviolable
secrecy, beloved. You understand, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I understand,” she replied proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could refuse—if you made a point of it. I’m a free
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her two hands on his shoulders—and ever after
he had this one more unforgettable picture of her—the
red bathing cap knotted in front, dainty, setting off her
dark eyes and her little eager face—the peignoir, carelessly
loose, revealing the sweet, frank mould of her figure
in the red bathing suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father and my two brothers gave their lives for
England. Do you think I could be so utterly selfish as
to grudge my country a week of my husband’s society?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her cheeks in his hands. “More and more do
you surpass the Princess of my dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “I’m an Englishwoman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so, you don’t want to know where I’m going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved aside. “Of course I do. I shall be in a
fever till you come back. But if I’m not to know—well—I’m
not to know. It’s enough for me that you’re serving
your country. Tell me,” she said suddenly, catching
him by the coat lapels. “There’s no danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “Not a little tiny bit. Of that you can
be assured. The worst is a voyage to Helsingfors and
back. So I gathered from the telegram, which was in
execrable Foreign Office Russian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the first train. I must report to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I come with you—as far as London?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He considered for a moment. “No,” he said. “Where
would you sleep? In all probability I shall have to take
the midnight boat to Havre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later they parted. She returned to the empty
house frightened at she knew not what, insecure, terrifyingly
alone; she was fretted by an uncanny sense of having
mated with the inhabitant of another planet who had
suddenly taken wing through the vast emptiness to the
strange sphere of his birth. She wandered up and down
the veranda, in and out of the three intimate rooms, where
the traces of his late presence, books, papers, clothes, lay
strewn carelessly about. She smiled wanly, reflecting
that he wore his surroundings loosely as he did his clothes.
Suddenly she uttered a little feminine cry, as her glance
fell on his wrist watch lying on the drawing-room mantelpiece.
He had forgotten it. She took it up with the
impulsive intention of posting it to him at once. But the
impulse fell into the nervelessness of death, when she
remembered that he had given her no address. She must
await his telegram—to-morrow, the next day, the day
after, he could not say. Meanwhile, he would be chafing
at the lack of his watch. She worried herself
infinitely over the trifle, unconsciously finding relief in
the definite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weary hours till night passed by. She tried to
read. She tried to eat. She thought of going over the
road to the Philimores’ for company; but her mood forbade.
For all their delicacy they would ask reasons for
this sudden abandonment. She magnified its importance.
She could have said: “My husband has gone to London
on business.” But to her brain, overwrought by sudden
emotion, the commonplace excuse seemed inadequate.
She shrank from the society of her kind friends, who
would regard this interplanetary mystery as a matter of
course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If only Alexis had taken his watch! Perhaps he would
have time to buy another—a consoling thought. Meanwhile
she strapped it on her own wrist, heroically resolved
not to part with it night or day until he returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat by the lamp on the sitting-room table, looking
out over the veranda at the pitch blackness of a breathless
night in which not even the mild beat of the surf could
be heard. She might have been in some far Pacific desert
island. Her book lay on her lap—the second volume of
Motley’s <span class='it'>Dutch Republic</span>. All the Alvas and Williams,
all the heroes and villains, all the soldiers and politicians
and burghers were comfortably dead hundreds of years
ago. What did these dead men matter, when one living
man, the equal of them all, had gone forth from her, into
the unknowableness of the night?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra came into the room with an amorphous bundle
in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The camp bed in the dressing-room isn’t very comfortable—but
I suppose I can sleep on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia turned swiftly in her chair, startled into human
realities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It’s a beast of a thing. But I should love to
have you to be with me. You’re a dear. You sleep in
my bed and I’ll take the dressing-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You once gave signs of being a woman of sense,” said
Myra tonelessly. “It seems I was mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She disappeared with her bundle. Olivia put out the
light and went to bed, where she lay awake all the night,
fantastically widowed, striving with every nerve and every
brain-cell to picture the contemporaneous situation of her
husband. Three o’clock in the morning. He would be
in mid-Channel. Had he secured a berth? Or was he
forced to walk up and down the steamer’s deck? Thank
Heaven, it was a black still night. She stole out of bed
and looked at the sea. A sea of oil. It was something
to be grateful for. But the poor boy without his watch—the
watch which had marked for him the laggard minutes
of captivity, the racing hours of approaching death, the
quiet, rhythmic companion and recorder of his amazing
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She forced all her will power to sleep; but the blank of
him there on the infinite expanse of mattress she felt like
a frost. The dawn found her with wide and sleepless
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while she was picturing this marvel among men
standing by the steamer’s side in the night, in communion
with the clear and heavy stars, holding in his adventurous
grasp the secret of a world’s peace, Alexis Triona was
speeding northwards, sitting upright in a third-class
carriage, to Newcastle-on-Tyne. And at Newcastle he
expected no ship to take him to Finland. Lucky if he
found a cab in the early morning to take him to his destination
three miles away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the telegram which he had torn to pieces had not
come from the War Office. It was not written in Russian.
It was in good, plain, curt English:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother dying. Come at once.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> <span class='sc'>TAXICAB</span> took him in dreary rain through the
squalor of Tyneside, now following the dismal
tram lines, now cutting through mean streets,
until they reached a row of low, bow-windows agglutinated
little villas with handkerchief of garden separating them
from the road. At No. 17 he dismissed the cab and swung
wide the flimsy gate. Before he could enter, the house
door opened and a woman appeared, worn and elderly, in
a cheap, soiled wrapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that’s you, John. I shouldn’t have
recognized you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke with a harsh, northern accent, and her face
betrayed little emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re Ellen,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye. I’m Ellen. You didn’t think I was Jane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way into a narrow passage and then into
the diminutive parlour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” said he. “Jane died three years ago.
But you I haven’t seen since I was a child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked him up and down: “Quite the gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so. How’s mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave the news dully. The sick woman had passed
through the night safely and was now asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had made up her mind to see you before she died—she
always was strong willed—and that has kept her alive.
Until I read your telegram I didn’t think you would
come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flashed one of his quick glances. “Why not?
This isn’t the first time I’ve come to see her since my
return. If I’ve made my way in the world, that’s no
reason for you to call me undutiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to quarrel, John,” she said wearily.
“Yes. I know about your visits and the bit of money
you send her. And she’s grateful, poor soul.” She
paused. Then: “You’ll be wanting breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Also a wash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you too grand for the sink, or must you have hot
water in your room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sink will do. It will be less trouble for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexis Triona followed her down the passage, and having
washed himself with a bit of yellow soap and dried
himself on the coarse towel hung on a stretch of string,
went into the tidy kitchen, hung with cheap prints and
faded photographs of departed Briggses, his coat over his
arm, and conversed with his sister in his shirt sleeves
while she fried the eggs and bacon for his meal. His
readiness to fall into the household ways somewhat
mollified her. Her mother had been full of pride in the
great man John had become, and she had expected the airs
and graces of the upstart. Living at Sunderland with her
husband, a foreman riveter, and her children, and going
filially to Newcastle only once a year, she had not met
him on his previous visits. Now her mother’s illness had
summoned her three or four days before, when the
neighbour’s daughter who “did for” Mrs. Briggs, ordinarily
a strong and active woman, found the sudden situation
beyond her powers and responsibility. So, until the
ailing lady discoursed to her of the paragon, she had
scarcely given him a thought for the sixteen years they
had been separated. Her memories of him as a child who
alternated exasperating mischief with bone-idle fits of
reading had not endeared him to her practical mind; and
when the impish dreamer disappeared into the vast inane
of foreign parts, and when she herself was driven by she
knew not what idiot romanticalism into the grey worries
of wifehood and motherhood, her consciousness recorded
the memory of a brother John, but whether he was alive
or dead or happy or miserable was a matter of illimitable
unconcern. Now, however, he had come to life, very
vivid, impressing her with a certain masterfulness in
his manner which had nothing to do with the airs and
graces she despised. Yet she still regarded him with suspicion;
even when, seating himself at the roughly laid end
of the kitchen table and devouring bacon and eggs with
healthy appetite, he enthusiastically praised her cookery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I can’t understand is,” she said, standing at the
other end of the table and watching him eat, “why the
name of John Briggs isn’t good enough for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s difficult to explain,” said he. “You see, I’ve
written a book. Have you read it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She regarded him scornfully. “Do you suppose, with
a husband and seven children I’ve time to waste on
books? I’ve seen it,” she admitted. “Mother has it
bound in brown paper, by the side of her bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must read it,” replied Triona, somewhat relieved.
“Then you’ll see why I’ve changed my name.” He
laughed at her uncomprehending face. “I’ve done nothing
criminal, you know, and I’m not hiding from justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose an outlandish name brings in more money,”
she suggested practically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fools must be fools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He acquiesced gladly, gauging the end of an embarrassing
examination, and turned the conversation to her
domestic affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breakfast over, he lit a cigarette and watched her clear
away, viewing through the smoke the memories of his
childhood. Just so, in that very wooden arm-chair,
though in another kitchen, used his father to sit, pipe
in mouth, while the women did the household work. It
was all so familiar, yet so far away. Between then and
now stretched a lifetime—so it seemed—of wide and
romantic happenings. There, before him, on the wall
hung, as it did years ago, the haunting coloured print,
cut from some Christmas Number, of young Amyas
Leigh listening to Salvation Yeo. As a child, Salvation
Yeo’s long arm and finger pointing out to sea had been his
inspiration. He had followed it, and gone to distant
lands and gone through the promised adventures, and
had returned to the picture, wondering whether all that
had been was real and not the figment of a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later, after the doctor’s visit, he was admitted
to his mother’s room. For an hour or so he sat with
her and gave a human being deep happiness. In the
afternoon she lost consciousness. For a day or two she
lingered on, and then she died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the dreary interval between his interview and
the funeral, Alexis Triona sat for many hours in his
father’s chair, for the North was smitten with a dismal
spell of rain and tempest which discouraged rambling
out of doors, reconstructing his life, unweaving fact from
fiction, tearing aside the veils of self-deception wherein
he had enwrapped his soul. Surely there was some
basis of fact in the romantic history of Alexis Triona
with which for the past year he had identified himself.
Surely a man could not dwell so intensely in an imaginary
life if none of it were real. Even while tearing open
veils and viewing his soul’s nakedness, he sought justification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did he not find it in that eagerness of spirit which
had sent him, in obedience to Salvation Yeo’s pointing
finger, away from the dour and narrow father and the
first taste of the Tyneside works, penniless, over the
wild North Sea to Archangel, town of fairy wonders, and
thence, so as not to be caught on the ship again and
taken back to Newcastle, to wanderings he scarce knew
whither? Did he not find it in the strange lure of Russia
which impelled him, when, after a few voyages, he landed
in the port of London, to procure a passport which would
make him free for the land of his fascination? Did he
not find it in the resourcefulness of brain which, the
mariner’s life forsaken, first secured him employment in
the English racing establishment of a Russian Prince,
and then interested recognition by the Princess herself,
so that, after a strenuous while he found himself no
longer as an inconsiderable stable hand, but as a human
being who counted in the world? Did he not find it in
his fond ambitions, when the Princess at his request
transferred him from stables to garage, from garage
to motor-works for higher training; when he set himself
to learn Russian as no Englishman should ever have
learned it; when afterwards he steeped his mind in
Russian poetry and folk-lore, sleeping four or five hours
a night, compelled by dreams of greatness in which there
figured as his bride of the golden future the little Princess
Tania, whose governess-taught English was as pure as
the church bells on a frosty night? Did he not find it
in those qualities of practical command of circumstance
and of poetic vision which had raised him in a few years
from the ragged, semi-ignorant, sea-faring English lout
alone in Russia to the trusted chief of a Prince’s fleet
of a dozen cars, to the courier-chauffeur, with all the
roads and ways and customs and languages of Russia,
from Riga to Tobolsk, and from Tobolsk to Tiflis, and
from Tiflis to St. Petersburg, at his finger tips; to the
Master of Russian Literature, already something of a
published poet, admitted into intellectual companionship
by the Prince and thereby given undreamed of leisure
for further intellectual development? What were those
qualities but the qualities of genius differentiating him
from the ordinary run of men and absolving him from
such judgments as might be passed upon the errant of
them? Without this absolving genius could he have
marched in and taken his place in the modern world of
English letters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, being of frugal tastes, he had grown rich
beyond the dream of the Tyneside urchin’s avarice. He
had visions of great motor-works, the manufacture of
an all-Russian car, built up by his own resources. The
princely family encouraged him. Negotiations had just
begun—was his story so devoid of truth?—when the
great world cataclysm brought more than his schemes
for an all-Russian car toppling to the ground. The
Prince’s household was disintegrated; horses and cars
were swallowed up in the great convulsion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself driving generals around the shell-scarred
front as a volunteer, for being of British nationality
he had not been called up for military service.
With them he served in advances and retreats and saw
battles and burnings like many millions of other men,
but from the comparative safety of a headquarters car.
It was not until he ran into the British Armoured Car
Column that his patriotism took fire, and he became a
combatant in British uniform. He remained with the
Column for most of the campaign. Badly wounded towards
the end, he was left in a Russian hospital, a
British naval rating. He remained there many months;
a bullet through his chest had missed a vital part and
the wound had soon healed, but his foot had gangrened,
and only the star in which he trusted had saved it from
amputation. There was no fiction about the three lost
toes whose gap he had shown to Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far did Alexis Triona, sitting in the kitchen arm-chair,
salve his conscience. In his story had he done more
than remodel the contour of fact? Beneath it did not
the living essence of truth persist? Was he not a highly
educated man? Had he not consorted—before the cataclysm,
and later in the strangely filled hospital—with
the young Russian <span class='it'>intelligentsia</span>, who talked and talked
and talked——? Who could know better than he how
Russia had floundered in their tempestuous ocean of
talk? And, finally, had he not gone, stout-hearted,
through the perils and hardships and exquisite sufferings
of the cataclysm?</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, so good. But what of the rest? For the rest,
was not Fate responsible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Revolution came, and Russian organization
crumbled like a castle touched with an enchanter’s
wand. He went forth healed from the hospital into
chaos; Petrograd, where his little fortune lay, his objective.
Sometimes he found a foothold on an aimless
train. Sometimes he jogged weary miles in a peasant’s
cart. Sometimes he walked. When he learned that
British uniform was no longer held in high esteem he
changed to peasant’s dress. So far his journey through
revolutionary Russia was true. But he had enough
money in his pocket to keep him from want.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then arrived the day which counted most in his
life’s history, when that which he had recounted to Olivia
as a fantastic possibility happened in sober fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been given to understand that if he walked
to a certain junction he might find a train returning to
Petrograd. Tired, he sat by the wayside, and undoing
his wallet ate the black bread and dried fish which he
had procured at the last village. And, while eating, he
became aware of something gleaming in the rank grasses
of the ditch—something long and pallid and horrible.
He slid down and found a dead man, stark naked, lying
on his back with the contused mark of a bullet hole
in his chest. A man of fifty, with short-cropped, grizzled
hair and moustache, and clear, refined features. He
must have been dead two days. There he lay, constricted
of limb, stripped of everything that could mean warmth
or comfort or money to his murderers. The living man’s
short experience told him that such things were not uncommon
in great revolutions. He was about to leave
the corpse—for what could he do?—when his eyes caught
the glint of metal a few feet away. It was a pocket
compass. And further on he found at intervals a toothbrush;
a coverless, tattered copy of Tacitus; a little
faded snapshot of a woman mounted on cardboard; a
vulcanite upper plate of half a dozen false teeth; and
a little fat book with curling covers of American cloth.
Had he continued his search he might have found many
other objects discarded by the robbers as useless. But
what was the good of pieces of conviction for a judicial
enquiry that would never take place? The little fat
book, which on opening he found to be manuscript in
minute handwriting, he thrust in his pocket. And so he
went his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on his way, his curiosity being aroused, he read
in the little book an absorbing diary of amazing adventures,
of hardships and prison and tortures unspeakable;
and without a thought of its value, further than
its romantic fascination, he grew to regard it during
his wanderings as his most precious possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far again, until he reached Riga, there was truth
in the story of his Russian traverse. Had he not prowled
suspect about revolutionary Petrograd? Had not the
Prince and Princess, the idealized parents of the story,
been murdered and their wealth, together with his own
few thousand roubles, been confiscated? Was he not a
fugitive? Indeed, had he not seen the inside of a horrible
prison? It is true that after a day or two he managed
by bribery to escape. But the essence of things
was there—the grain of fact which, under the sunlight
of his genius, expanded into the splendid growth of Truth.
And his wit had served him, too. His guards were for
taking away the precious book. Knowing them to be
illiterate, he declared it to be the manuscript of his republican
poem. Challenged to read, he recited from
memory verses of Shevchenko, until they were convinced,
not only of the book’s contents, but of his own revolutionary
opinions. This establishment of his orthodoxy,
together with a few roubles, assured his escape. And
thence had he not gone northwards, hungry and footsore?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And had he not been torpedoed? Cast ashore in shirt
and trousers, penniless? Was not the real truth of this
adventure even more to his credit than the fictitious narrative?
For, a naval rating, he had reported to a British
man-of-war, and had spent months in a mine sweeper
in the North Sea, until the final catastrophe occurred.
Then, after a short time in hospital a kindly medical
board found something wrong with his heart and sent
him out into the English world, a free man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes. His real record was one that no man need be
ashamed of. Why, then, the fiction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting there in the uncompromising reality of his
mother’s kitchen, he strove for the first time to answer
the question. He found an answer in the obsession of
the little book. During the scant leisure of his months
at sea it had been his breviary. More, it had been a
talisman, a secret scroll of enchantment which, wrapped
in oilskin, never left his person, save when, beneath the
dim lamp of the fo’c’sle, he pored over it, hunched up
against a bulkhead. The spirit of the writer whom he
had seen dead and naked, seemed to have descended upon
him. In the bitter watches of the North Sea he lived
through the dead man’s life with bewildering intensity.
There were times, so he assured himself, when it became
a conscious effort to unravel his own experiences from
those of the dead man. That he had not lived in remoter
Kurdistan was unthinkable. And, surely too, he had
been tortured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when, in the attic in Cherbury Mews, impelled
by irresistible force, he began to write his fantasia of
fact and imagination, the obsession grew mightier. His
pen was winged with flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said he, half aloud, one day, staring into the
kitchen fire, “why should it not be a case of psychic obsession
for which I am not responsible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was the most comforting solution he could
find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was none other. He moved uneasily, changing
the crossing of his legs, and threw a freshly rolled and
lighted cigarette into the grate. It was a case of psychic
obsession. Otherwise he was a barefaced liar, a worm
to be despised by his fellow-men. How else to account
for the original lie direct, unreserved, to the publisher?
Up to then he had no thought of sailing through the
world under false colours. He had to give the mysterious
dead man some identity. His own unconscious creative
self clamoured for expression. He had woven the dead
man and himself into a personality to which he had given
the name of Alexis Triona. Naturally, for verisimilitude,
he had assumed “Alexis Triona” as a pen-name. Besides,
who would read a new book by one John Briggs?
The publisher’s first direct question was a blow between
the eyes under which he reeled for a few seconds. Then
the romantic, the psychic, the whatever you will of the
artist’s touch of lunacy asserted itself, and John Briggs
was consumed in ashes and the Phœnix Alexis Triona
arose in his stead. And when the book appeared and
the Phœnix leaped into fame, what could the Phœnix
do, for the sake of its ordinary credit, but maintain its
Phœnixdom?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until now it had been the simplest matter in the world,
seeing that he half believed in it himself, seeing that the
identification of the dead man with himself was so complete,
that his lies, even to himself, had the generous air
of conviction. But now, in the uncompromising John
Briggs-dom of his surroundings, things were different.
The obsession which still lingered when he bade Olivia
adieu had vanished from his spirit. He saw himself
naked, a mere impostor. If his past found absolution
in the theory of psychic domination, his present was
none the less in a parlous state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no more gone to Helsingfors in the last year’s
autumn than he had gone there now. What should John
Briggs, obscure and demobilized able seaman, have to
do in Helsingfors? Why the elaborate falsehood? He
shrugged his shoulders and made a helpless gesture with
his elbows. The obsession again. The quietude of
Medlow had got on his nerves. He had to break away,
to seek fresh environment. He had invented Helsingfors;
it was dramatic, in his romantic past; it kept up,
in the direct mind of Blaise Olifant, the mystery of Alexis
Triona; and it gave him freedom. He had spoken truth
as to his vagabond humour. He loved the eternal change
of the broad highway. The Salvation Yeo inspiration
had persisted ever since he had run away from home to
the El Dorado beyond the seas. Had he been set down
in a torpid household, no matter how princely, sooner
or later he would have revolted and have fled, smitten
with the wander madness. But the Prince, the nomadic
Tartar atavism asserting itself, suffered too much from
this unrest; and in their mighty journeyings through
Russia, up and down, north and south, east and west,
and in the manifold adventures and excitements by the
way, the young chief mechanic found the needful satisfaction
of his cravings. On leaving Medlow he had
started on a tramp, knapsack on back, to the north of
Scotland, stopping at his mother’s house, <span class='it'>en route</span>, and
had reached the John o’ Groats whither, on an eventful
day, Olivia had professed herself ready to accompany
him. She had little guessed how well he knew that long,
long road.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet, when he met Blaise Olifant again,
and was forced to vague allusion to his mythical travels,
he almost persuaded himself that he had just arrived
from Finland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now had come an irreparable shifting of psychological
values. He could not return to Olivia, eating her
heart out for news of him, and persuade himself that he
had been to Helsingfors. The lie had been facile enough.
How else to account for his absence? His attendance at
his mother’s death-bed had been imperative: to disregard
the summons had never entered his mind. Yet simple
avowal would have been pulling down the keystone of
the elaborate structure which, to her, represented Alexis
Triona. The parting lie had been easy: but the lie on
his return—the inevitable fabrication of imaginary travel—that
would be hatefully difficult. For the first time
since he had loved her he was smitten with remorse for
his deception and with terror of her discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not sleep of nights aching for her, shivering
with dread at the possibility of loss of her, picturing her
alone in the sweet, wind-swept house, utterly trustful
and counting the long hours till he should come again.
Still, thank God, this was the last time they would be
parted. His mother had been the only link to his John
Briggs past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no testamentary complications, which he
had somewhat feared. His mother had only a life interest
in the tiny estate which went, under his father’s
will, to his sister Ellen. And Ellen did not count. Absorbed
in her family cares, she would pass out of his
life for ever without thought of regret. It would be the
final falsehood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast, on the morning of the funeral, Ellen
said suddenly, in her dour way:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been reading your book. It’s a pack of lies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have been if I had signed it John Briggs,”
he answered. “But everything in it is true about Alexis
Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your ways don’t seem to be our ways, John,” she
remarked coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt the words like a slap in the face. He flushed
with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” she answered. “I oughtn’t to have said
it with mother lying cold upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shrugged his shoulders, forced to accept the evasive
apology. But her challenge rankled. They parted stonily
after the funeral, with the perfunctory handshake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose I shall ever see you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather unlikely,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw himself back in the taxi-cab with a great sigh
of relief. Thank God the nightmare of the past few
days was over. Now to awaken to the real and wonderful
things of life—the miraculous love of the dark-eyed,
quivering princess of his dreams: the work which
since he had loved her had grown into the sacred aim of
their perfect lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And just as he had wired her from Newcastle announcing
his sailing, so did he wire her when he reached the
railway station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrived. All well. Speeding straight to you with
love and longing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia smiled as she kissed the telegram. No one but
her Alexis would have used the word “speeding.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> was waiting for him at the little South Coast
station, where decorum had to cloak the rapture
of their meeting. But they sat close together,
hand in hand, in the hackney motor-car that took them
home. This gave him an intermediary breathing space
for explanation; and the explanation was easier than he
had feared. Really, his journey had been almost for
nothing and had afforded little interest. The agent
whom he was to interview having been summoned back
to Russia the day before he arrived, he had merely delivered
his dispatches to the British authorities and taken
the next boat to England. It was just a history of two
dull sea voyages. Nothing more was to be said about
it, save that he would go on no more fool’s errands for a
haphazard government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, it’s too dreadful to be away from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been awful for me, too,” said Olivia. “I never
imagined what real loneliness could feel like. All the
time I thought of the poor solitary little dab the Bryce
children showed us the other day in the biscuit-tin of
water. Oh, I was the most forsaken little dab.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swore that she should never be lonely again; and,
by the time they reached their house by the sea, he had
half-exultingly dismissed his fictitious mission from his
mind. All the apprehensions of the narrow Northern
kitchen melted in the joy of her. All danger had vanished
like a naughty black cloud sped to nothing by the
sun. The mythical past had to remain; but henceforward
his life would be as clear to her as her own exquisite life
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In their wind-swept home they gave themselves up
to deferred raptures, kissing and laughing after the foolish
way of lovers. To grace his return she had filled
the rooms with flowers—roses and sweet peas—which
she bought extravagantly in the neighbouring seaside
town. The scent of them mingled delicately with the
salt of the sea. To her joy he was quick to praise them.
She had wondered whether they would be noticed by
one so divinely careless of material things. He even
found delight in the meal which Myra served soon after
their arrival—he so indifferent to quality of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything is you,” said he; “scent and taste and
sight. You inform the universe and give it meaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes grew moist as she swiftly laid her hand on
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I really all that to you?” She laughed with a
little catch in her throat. “How can I live up to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised her hand to his lips. “If only you went
on existing like a flower, your beauty and fragrance
would be all in all to me. But you are a flower with a
bewildering soul. So you merely have to be as you
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in earnest. Women had played little or no
part in his inner life, which, for all his follies, had been
lived on a spiritual plane. His young ambitions had
been irradiated by dreams of the little Princess Tania,
who had represented to him the ever-to-be-striven-for
unattainable. On his reaching the age when common
sense put its clammy touch on fervid imagination, the
little Princess had been given away in marriage to a
young Russian nobleman of vast fortune, and he himself
had driven her to the wedding with naught but a
sentimental pang. But the flower-like, dancing, elusive
quality of her had remained in his soul as that which
was only desirable and ever to be sought for in woman.
And—miracle of miracles!—he had found it in Olivia.
And she was warm and real, the glowing incarnation of
the cold but perfect ghost of his boyhood’s aspirations.
She was verily the Princess of his dream come true. And
she had an odd air of the little Princess Tania—the
same dark, wavy hair and laughing eyes and the same
crisp sweetness in her English speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Save for all this rapture of meeting, they took up the
thread of their lives where it had been broken, as though
no parting had taken place, and their idyll continued to
run its magic course. Triona began to write again: some
articles, a short story. The shadow shape of a new
novel arose in his mind, and, in his long talks with Olivia,
gradually attained coherence. This process of creation
seemed to her uncanny. Where did the people come
from who at first existed as formless spirits and then,
in some strange way, developed into living things of
flesh and blood more real than the actual folk of her
acquaintance? Her intimate association with the novelist’s
gift brought her nearer to him intellectually, but at
the same time set him spiritually on unattainable heights.
Meanwhile he called her his Inspiration, which filled her
with pride and content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lease of “Quien Sabe” all but expired before they
had settled on their future house. Medlow was ruled
out. So was the immediate question of the Medlow
furniture, they having given Blaise Olifant another year’s
tenancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While discussing this step, he had said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s for you and you only to decide. Any spot on
earth where you are is good enough for me. By instinct
I’m a nomad. If I hadn’t found you, I should have gone
away somewhere to the desert and lived in tents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, who had seen so little of the great world, felt a
thrill of pulses and put her hands on his shoulders—she
was standing behind his chair—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head and glanced up at her. The way of
the gipsy was too hard for his English flower. She must
dwell in her accustomed garden. In practical terms,
they must settle down for her sake. She protested. Of
herself she had no thought. He and his work were of
paramount importance. Had they not planned the ideal
study, the central feature of the house? He had laughed
and mangled Omar. A pen and a block of paper .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
Thou beside me, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe you want to settle down a bit,” she
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung his chair and caught her round her slim
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eventually, of course——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, before ‘eventually,’ don’t you want your wander-year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“France, Italy——” She became breathless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honolulu, the Pacific, the wide world. Why should
we tie ourselves to a house until we have seen it all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, why? We have all our lives before us.” She
sank on his knee. “How beautiful! Let us make
plans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So for the next few days they lived in a world of visions,
catching enthusiasm one from the other. Again he
saw Salvation Yeo’s pointing finger; and she, in the subconscious
relation of her mind with his, saw it too.
House and furniture were Olifant’s as long as he wanted
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go round the world,” Olivia declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a twirl of his finger—“Right round,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way does one go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was somewhat vague. An atlas formed no part
of their personal equipment or of the hireling penates of
“Quien Sabe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll write to Cook’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cook’s? My beloved, where is your sense of adventure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go by trains and steamers, and Cook’s will
tell us all about them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had her way. Cook’s replied. At the quotation
for the minimum aggregate of fares Alexis gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not so much money in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is,” she flashed triumphantly. “On deposit
at my bank. Much more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who was right now, she asked herself, she or the
prosaic Mr. Trivett and Mr. Fenmarch? She only had
to dip her hands into her fortune and withdraw them
filled with bank-notes enough to take them half a dozen
times round the world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inspired by this new simplicity of things, they rushed
up to London by an incredibly early train to take tickets,
then and there for the main routes which circumnavigate
the globe. The man at Cook’s dashed their ardour.
They would have to pencil their passages now and wait
for months until their turn on the waiting lists arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be remembered that then were the early days
of Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we want to start next week!” cried Olivia in dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man at Cook’s professed polite but wearied
sorrow at her disappointment. Forty times a day he had
to disillusion eager souls who wanted to start next
week for the other side of the globe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is most inconvenient and annoying for us to change
our plans,” Olivia declared resentfully. “But,” she
added, with a smile, “it’s not your fault that the world
is a perfect beast. We’ll talk it over and come to you
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So after lunch in town they returned to The Point,
richer in their knowledge of the conditions of contemporary
world travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll put things in hand at once and start about
Christmas,” said Alexis. “Until then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take a furnished flat in London,” Olivia decided.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>October found them temporarily settled in a flat in
the Buckingham Palace Road, and then began the life
which Olivia had schemed for her husband before these
disturbing dreams of vagabondage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards the end of their stay in “Quien Sabe” various
letters of enquiry and invitations had been forwarded
to Triona from people, back now in London, with whom
the success of his book had brought him into contact.
These, careless youth, he had been for ignoring, but the
wiser Olivia had stepped in and dictated tactful and informative
replies. The result was their welcome in many
houses remote from the Lydian galley, the Blenkiron
home of Bolshevism and even the easy conservative dullness
of the circle of Janet Philimore. The world that
danced and ate and dressed and thought and felt to the
unvarying rhythm of jazz music had passed away like
a burnt-up planet. The world which she entered with
her husband was astonishingly new with curious ramifications.
At the houses of those whose cultivated pleasure
in life it is to bring together people worthy of note she
met artists, novelists, journalists, actors, publishers,
politicians, travellers, and their respective wives or husbands.
Jealously, at first, she watched the attitude of
all these folk towards her husband: in pride and joy she
saw him take his easy place among them as an equal.
A minority of silly women flattered him—to his obvious
distaste—but the majority accepted him on frank and
honourable terms. She loved to watch him, out of the
corner of her eye, across the drawing-room, his boyish
face flushed and eager, talking in his swift, compelling
way. His manners, so simple, so direct, so different from
the elaboration of Sidney Rooke, even from the cut-and-dried
convention of Mauregard, had a charm entirely
individual. There was no one like him in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In their turn, many of the people of note they met
at the houses of the primary entertainers invited them
to their homes. Thus, in a brief time, Olivia found herself
swept into as interesting a social circle as the heart
of ambitious young woman could crave. How far her
own grace and wit contributed to their success it never
entered her head to enquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona, light-hearted, gave himself up to the pleasure
of this new existence. He found in it stimulus to work,
being in touch with the thought and the art of the moment.
The newness of his Odyssey having worn off, he
was no longer compelled to dilate on his extraordinary
adventures; people, growing unconsciously impatient of
the realistic details of the late cataclysm, conspired to
regard him more as a writer than as a heroic personage;
wherein he experienced mighty relief. He could talk
of other things than the habits of the dwellers round
Lake Baikal and the amenities of Bolshevik prisons.
When conversation drifted into such channels, he employed
a craftiness of escape which he had amused himself
to develop. Freed from the obsession of the little
black book, he regarded his Russian life as a phase remote,
as a tale that was told. His facile temperament put the
whole matter behind him. He lived for the future, when
he should be the acknowledged English Master of
Romance, and when Olivia’s burning faith in his genius
should be justified. He threw off memories of Ellen and
the kitchen chair and went his way, a man radiant with
happiness. Each day intensified the wonder of his wife.
From the lips and from the writings of fools and philosophers
he had heard of the perils of the first year of
marriage; of the personal equations that seemed impossible
of simultaneous solution; of the misunderstandings,
cross-purposes, quarrels inevitable to the attempt; of
the hidden snags of feminine unreason that shipwrecked
logical procedure; of the love-rasping persistence of
tricks of manner or speech which either had to be violently
broken or to be endured in suffering sullenness.
At both fools and philosophers he mocked. A fiction,
this dogma of inescapable sex warfare. Never for a
second had a cloud arisen on their horizon. The flawlessness
of Olivia he accepted as an axiom. Equally
axiomatic was his own faultiness. In their daily lives
he was aware of his thousand lapses from her standard
of grace, when John Briggs happened to catch Alexis
Triona at unguarded moments and threw him from his
seat. But, in a flash, the instinctive, the super-instinctive,
the nothing less than Divine hand, was stretched out
to restore him to his throne. As a guide to conduct she
became his conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Work and love and growing friendship filled his care-free
days. His novel was running serially in a weekly
and attracting attention. It would be published in book-form
early in the New Year, and the publishers had no
doubt of its success. All was well with the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile they concerned themselves busily, like
happy children, with their projects of travel. It was a
great step to book berths for Bombay by a January boat.
They would then cross India, visit Burmah, the Straits
Settlements, Australia, Japan, America. All kinds of
Companies provided steamers; Providence would procure
the accommodation. They planned a detailed six months’
itinerary which would take a conscientious globe-trotter
a couple of years to execute. Before launching on this
eastern voyage they would wander at their ease through
France, see Paris and Monte Carlo, and pick up the
boat at Marseilles. As the year drew to its close their
excitement waxed more unrestrained. They babbled
to their envious friends of the wonder-journey before
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaise Olifant, who, on his periodical visits to London,
was a welcome visitor at their flat, was entertained with
these anticipations of travel. He listened with the air
of elderly indulgence that had been his habit since their
marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you wish you were coming with us?” asked
Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Don’t you remember the first
time I saw you I said I was done with adventures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I said I was going in search of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re each getting your heart’s desire,” said
Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” replied Olifant, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a touch of sadness in it which did not escape
Olivia’s shrewd glance. He had grown thinner during
the year; his nose seemed half-comically to have grown
sharper and longer. In his eyes dwelt a shadow of wistful
regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The life of a hermit cabbage isn’t good for you,” she
said. “Give it up and come with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he shook his head. No. They did not want
such a drag on the wheels of their joyous chariot. Besides,
he was tied to Medlow as long as she graciously
allowed him to live there. His sister had definitely left
her dissolute husband and was living under his protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should be living under the protection of a wife,”
Olivia declared. “I’ve told you so often, haven’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ve always answered that bachelors are born,
not made—and I’m one born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Predestination! Rubbish!” cried Triona, rising with
a laugh. “Your Calvinistic atavism is running away
with you. It’s time for your national antidote. I’ll
bring it in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out of the room, in his boyish way, in search
of whisky. Olivia leaned forward in her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may not know it, but from that first day a year
ago you made yourself a dear friend—so you’ll forgive
me if I——” She paused for a second, and went on
abruptly: “You’ve changed. Now and then you look
so unhappy. I wish I could help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “It’s very dear of you to think of me,
Lady Olivia—but the change is not in me. I’ve remained
the same. It’s your eyes that have grown so
accustomed to the radiant gladness of a happy man that
they expect the same in any old fossil on the beach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you make me feel utterly selfish,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We oughtn’t to look so absurdly happy. It’s indecent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it does one good,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona entered with the tray, and administered whisky
and soda to his guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! When you’ve drunk it you’ll be ready to
come to the Magical Isles with us, where the Lady of
Ladies awaits you in an enchanted valley, with hybiscus
in her hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk grew light, drifted inevitably into the details
of their projected wanderings. The evening ended pleasantly.
Olivia bade Olifant farewell, promising, as he
would not go in search of her himself, to bring him back
the perfect lady of the hybiscus crown. Triona accompanied
him to the landing; and, while they stood awaiting
the lift, Olifant said casually:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’ve got your passports?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Passports?” The young man knitted his brow in
some surprise. “Why, of course. That’s to say, I’ve not
bothered about them yet, but they’ll be all right. Why
do you ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re Russian subjects. There may be difficulties.
If there are, I know a man in the Foreign Office who may
be of help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lift rose and the gates clashed open, and the
attendant came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks very much,” said Triona. “It’s awfully
good of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shook hands, wished each other God-speed, and
the cage went down, leaving Triona alone on the landing,
gaping across the well of the lift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was aroused from a semi-stupor by Olivia’s voice
at the flat door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you doing, darling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He realized that he must have been there some appreciable
time. He turned with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was interested in the mechanism of the lift; it has
so many possibilities in fiction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “Think of them to-morrow. It’s time
for good little novelists to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that night, while Olivia, blissfully unconscious of
trouble, slept the happy sleep of innocence Alexis Triona
did not close an eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passports! He had not given them a thought. Any
decent person was entitled to a passport. In the plenitude
of his English content he had forgotten his fictitious
Russian citizenship. To attest or even to support this
claim there was no creature on God’s earth. The details
of his story of the torpedoed Swedish timber boat in
which he had taken refuge would not bear official examination.
Application for passport under the name of
Alexis Triona, soi-disant Russian subject, would involve
an investigation leading to inevitable exposure. His civic
status was that of John Briggs, late naval rating. He
had all his papers jealously locked up, together with the
little black notebook, in his despatch case. As John
Briggs, British subject, he was freeman of the civilized
world. But John Briggs was dead and done for. It was
impossible to wander over the globe as Alexis Triona with
a passport bearing the name of John Briggs. He would
be held up and turned back at any frontier. And it was
beyond his power of deception to induce Olivia to travel
with him round the world under the incognito of Mrs.
John Briggs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rigid, so that he should not wake the beloved woman,
he stared for hours and hours into the darkness, vainly
seeking a solution. And there was none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He might blind Olivia into the postponement of their
adventure, and in the meanwhile change his name by
deed poll. But that would involve the statutory publicity
in the Press. The declaration in <span class='it'>The Times</span> that
he, John Briggs, would henceforth take the name of
Alexis Triona would stultify him in the social and literary
world—and damn him in the eyes of Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those early days after the War, the Foreign Office
granted passports grudgingly. British subjects had to
show very adequate reasons for desiring to go abroad,
and foreign visas were not over-readily given. In the
process of obtaining a passport, a man’s identity had to
be established beyond question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered now having heard vague talk of spies;
but he had paid no attention to it. Now he realized that
which he had heard was cruelly definite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no solution. John Briggs was dead, and
Alexis Triona had no official existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not get as far as Boulogne, let alone Japan.
And there was Olivia by his side dreaming of the Fortunate
Isles.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>B</span><span class='sc'>UT</span> for Olivia’s unquestioning faith in him he
would not have pulled through this passport
quagmire. At every fresh lie he dreaded lest
her credulity should reach the breaking point. For he
had to lie once more—and this time with revulsion and
despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began the abominable campaign the next evening
after dinner. He had been absent all day, on the vague
plea of business. In reality he had walked through
London and wandered about the docks, Ratcliffe Highway,
the Isle of Dogs. He had returned physically and
spiritually worn out. Her solicitude smote him. It was
nothing. A little worry which the sight of her would
dispel. They dined and went into the drawing-room.
She sat on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now the worry, poor boy. Anything I can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared into the fire. “It’s our trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what has gone wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything,” he groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, darling!” She gripped his shoulder. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it’s a beautiful dream, my dear. We must
call it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She uttered a breathless “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s far beyond our means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke into her gay laugh and hugged him and
called him a silly fellow. Hadn’t they settled all that
side of it long ago? Her fingers were itching to draw
cheques. She had scarcely put pen to pink paper since
their marriage. Hadn’t he insisted on supporting her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll go on insisting,” said he. “I’m not the man
to live on my wife’s money. No, no——” with uplifted
hand he checked her generous outburst. “I know what
you’re going to say, sweetheart, but it can’t be done. I
was willing for you to advance a certain amount. But
I would have paid it back—well, I would have accepted
it if it gave you pleasure. Anyhow, things are different
now. Suddenly different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He writhed under the half-truths, the half-sincerities
he was speaking. In marrying her his conscience absolved
him of fortune seeking. It had been the pride of
his Northumbrian blood to maintain his wife as she
should be maintained, out of his earnings—this draft on
her fortune for the jaunt he had made up a Tyneside
mind to repay. Given the passport, the whole thing was
as simple as signing a cheque. But no passports to be
given, he had to lie. How else, in God’s name, to explain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said he, in answer to her natural question,
“there’s one thing about myself I’ve not told you.
It has seemed quite unimportant. In fact, I had practically
forgotten it. But this is the story. During my
last flight through Russia a friend, one of the old Russian
nobility, gave me shelter. He was in hiding, dressed as
a peasant. His wife and children had escaped the Revolution
and were, he was assured, in England. He entrusted
me with a thousand pounds in English bank-notes
which he had hidden in a scapulary hanging round his
neck, and which I was to give to his family on my arrival.
I followed his example and hung the few paper roubles
I had left, together with his money, round my neck. As
you know, I was torpedoed. I was hauled out of the
water in shirt and drawers, and landed penniless. The
string of the scapulary had broken, and all the money
was at the bottom of the North Sea. I went to every
conceivable Russian agency in London to get information
about the Vronsky family. There was no trace of them.
I came to the conclusion that they had never landed
in England, and to-day I found I was right. They
hadn’t. They had disappeared off the face of the
earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day?” queried Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This morning. I had a letter from Vronsky forwarded
by the publishers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell me?” cried Olivia. “I had an
idea you weren’t quite yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want to worry you without due reason,” he
explained, “and I was upset. It was like a message from
the dead. For, not having heard of him all this time, I
concluded he had perished, like so many others, at the
hands of the Bolsheviks. Anyhow, there he was alive in
a little hotel in Bloomsbury. Of course, I had to go and
rout him out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I found him. He had managed to escape, with
the usual difficulties, and was now about to search Europe
for his family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a terrible quest,” said Olivia, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s awful, isn’t it?” replied Triona in a voice
of deep feeling—already half beginning himself to believe
in the genuineness of his story—“I spent a heart-rending
day with him. He had expected to find his
family in England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you wrote to him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. But how many letters to Russia reach
their destination? Their letters, too, have miscarried or
been seized. He hadn’t had news of them since they left
Petrograd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carried away by the tragedy of this Wandering Jew
hunt for a lost family, Olivia forgot the reason for its
recital. She questioned, Triona responded, his picturesque
invention in excited working. He etched in details.
Vronsky’s declension from the ruddy, plethoric gentleman,
with good-humoured Tartar face, to the gaunt, hollow-eyed
grey-beard, with skinny fingers on which the
nails grew long. The gentle charm of the lost Madame
Vronsky and the beauty of her two young daughters,
Vera and Sonia. The faithful moujik who had accompanied
them on their way and reported that they had
sailed on the <span class='it'>Olger Danske</span> from Copenhagen for London.
He related their visit to Lloyds, where they had
learned that no such ship was known. Certainly at the
time of the supposed voyage it had put into no British
port. Vronsky was half mad. No wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you leave him? Why didn’t you bring him
here?” asked Olivia, her eyes all pity and her lips parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked him. He wouldn’t come. He must begin his
search at once—take ship for Denmark.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Meanwhile,
dearest,” he said after a pause, “being practically
without resources, he referred to his thousand pounds.
That’s where you and I come in. He entrusted me with
the money and the accident of losing it could not relieve
me of the responsibility—could it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced a challenge. Her uprightness waved it
aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I took him to my bank and gave him the thousand
pounds in Bank of England notes. So, my dear,
we’re all that to the bad on our balance sheet. We’re
nearly broke—and we’ll have to put off our trip round
the world to more prosperous times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although, womanlike, she tried at first to kick against
the pricks, parading the foolish fortune lying idle at the
bank, that was the end of the romantic project. Her
common sense asserted itself. A thousand pounds, for
folks in their position, was a vast sum of money. She
resigned herself with laughing grace to the inevitable, and
poured on her husband all the consolation for disappointment
that her heart could devise. Their pleasant life
went on. Deeply interested in Vronsky, she questioned
him from time to time. Had he no news of the tragic
wanderer? At last, in February, he succumbed to the
temptation to finish for ever with these Frankenstein
monsters. He came home one afternoon, and after kissing
her said with a gay air:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found a letter at Decies Street”—the house of his
publishers—“from whom do you think? From Vronsky.
Just a few lines. He tracked his family to Palermo
and they’re all as happy as can be. How he did it
he doesn’t say, which is disconcerting, for one would like
to know the ins and outs of his journeyings. But there’s
the fact, and now we can wipe Vronsky off our slate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March the novel appeared. Reviewers lauded it
enthusiastically as a new note in fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The freshness of subject, outlook, and treatment appealed
to the vastly superior youth, the disappointed old,
and the scholarly and conscientious few, who write literary
criticism. The great firm of publishers smiled urbanely.
Repeat orders on a gratifying scale poured in
every day. Triona took Olivia to Decies Street to hear
from publishing lips the splendid story. They went
home in a taxi-cab, their arms around each other, intoxicated
with the pride of success and the certainty of their
love. And the next day Olivia said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can’t go round the world, at any rate let us have
a holiday. Let us go to Paris. We can afford it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Triona, who for months had foreseen such a reasonable
proposal, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we could. I’ve been dreaming of it for a long
time. In fact—I didn’t tell you—but I went to the
Foreign Office a fortnight ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wrinkled her brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the Foreign Office got to do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They happen to regard me as an exceptional man,
my dearest,” said he. “I’m still in the Secret Service.
I tried last summer to get out of it—but they overpersuaded
me, promising not to worry me unduly. One can’t
refuse to serve one’s country at a pinch, can one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt hurt at being left out in the cold. She also
had a sudden fear of the elusiveness of this husband of
hers, hero of so many strange adventures and interests
that years would not suffice for their complete revelation.
She remembered the dug-up Vronsky romance, in itself
one that might supply the ordinary human being with
picturesque talk for a lifetime. And now she resented
this continued association with the Foreign Office which
he thought he had severed on his return from Finland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never imagined they would want me again, after
what I told them. But it seems they do. You know
the state of things in Russia. Well—they may send me
or they may not. At any rate, for the next few months
I am not to leave the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call that idiotic,” cried Olivia indignantly. “They
could get at you in Paris just as easily as they could in
London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got the whip hand, confound them,” replied
Triona. “They grant or refuse passports.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Foreign Office is a beast!” said Olivia. “I’d like
to tell them what I think of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do,” said he with a laugh, “but don’t tell anybody
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She believed him. He breathed again. The difficulty
was over for the present. Meanwhile he called himself
a fool for not having given her this simple explanation
months ago. Why had he racked his conscience with
the outrageous fiction of the Vronskys?</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time, too, in her innocence, she raised the
question of his technical nationality. It was absurd for
him to continue to be a Russian subject. A son of
English parents, surely he could easily be naturalized.
He groaned inwardly at this fresh complication, and
cursed the name of Triona. He put her off with vague intentions.
One of these days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was no great
hurry. She persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so unlike you,” she declared, uncomprehending.
“You who do things so swiftly and vividly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have some sort of papers establishing my
identity,” he explained. “My word won’t do. We must
wait till there’s a settled government in Russia to which
I can apply. I know it’s an unsatisfactory position for
both; but it can’t be helped.” He smiled wearily. “You
mustn’t reproach me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reproach you—my dearest——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea shocked her. She only had grown impatient
of the intangible Russian influences that checked his
freedom of action. Sometimes she dreaded them, not
knowing how deep or how sinister they might be. Secret
agents were sometimes mysteriously assassinated. He
laughed at her fears. But what else, she asked herself,
could he do but laugh? She was not reassured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The naturalization question settled for an indefinite
time, he felt once more in clear water. Easter came
and went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I don’t move about a little, I shall die,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us move about a lot,” said Olivia. “Let us hire
a car and race about Great Britain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waxed instantly enthusiastic. She was splendid.
Always the audacious one. A car—a little high-powered
two-seater. Just they two together. Free of the
high road! If they could find no lodgings at inns they
could sleep beneath the hedges. They would drive anywhere,
losing their way, hitting on towns with delicious
unexpectancy. The maddest motor tour that was ever
unplanned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the excitement of the new idea, the disappointment
over the prohibited foreign travel vanished from their
hearts. Once more they contemplated their vagabondage,
with the single-mindedness of children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll start to-morrow,” he declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow evening is the Rowingtons’ dinner-party,”
Olivia reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He confounded Rowington and his dinner-party. Why
not send a telegram saying he was down with smallpox?
He hated literary dinner-parties. Why should he make
an ass of himself in a lion’s skin—just to gratify the
vanity of a publisher? Olivia administered the required
corrective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it rather a case of the lion putting on an ass’s
skin, my dear? Of course we must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “I suppose we must. Anyway, we’ll
start the day after. I’ll see about the car in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out immediately after breakfast, and in a
couple of hours returned radiant. He was in luck, having
found the high-powered two-seater of his dreams.
He overwhelmed her with enthusiastic technicalities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You beloved infant,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before they could set out in this chariot of force
and speed, something happened. It happened at the
dinner-party given by Rowington, the active partner
in the great publishing house, in honour of their twice-proved
successful author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rowingtons lived in a mansion at the southern end
of Portland Place. It had belonged to his father and
grandfather before him and the house was filled with
inherited and acquired treasures. On entering, Triona
had the same sense of luxurious comfort as on that far-off
day of the first interview in Decies Street, when his
advancing foot stepped so softly on the thick Turkey
carpet. A manservant relieved him of his coat and hat,
a maid took Olivia for an instant into a side-room whence
she reappeared bare-necked, bare-armed, garbed, as her
husband whispered, in cobweb swept from Heaven’s rafters.
A manservant at the top of the stairs announced
them. Mrs. Rowington, thin, angular, pince-nez’d, and
Rowington, middle-aged, regarding the world benevolently
through gold spectacles, received them and made the
necessary introduction to those already present. There
was a judge of the High Court, a well-known novelist, a
beautiful and gracious woman whom Olivia, with a little
catch of the heart, recognized as the Lady Aintree who
had addressed a passing word of apology to her in the
outgoing theatre crush in the first week of her emancipation.
She envied Alexis who stood in talk with her.
She herself was trying to correlate the young and modern
bishop, in plum-coloured evening dress, with the billow
of lawn semi-humanized by a gaunt staring head and a
pair of waxen hands which had gone through the dimly
comprehended ritual of her confirmation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He explained his presence in this brilliant assembly on
the ground that once he had written an obscure book of
travels in Asia Minor. St. Paul’s steps retraced. He had
fought with beasts at Ephesus—but not of the kind to
which the apostle was presumed to refer; disgusting little
beasts! He also swore “By Jove!” which she was sure
her confirming bishop would never have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A while later, as the room was filling up, she found
herself talking to a Colonel Onslow, an authority on Kurdistan,
said her hostess, who was anxious to meet her husband.
She glanced around, her instinctive habit, to
place Alexis. He had been torn from Lady Aintree and
was standing just behind her by the chimney-piece in
conversation with a couple of men. His eyes caught
the message of love in hers and telegraphed back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He no longer confounded Rowington. The central
figure of this distinguished gathering, he glowed with the
divine fire of success. He was talking to two elderly
men on Russian folk literature. On that he was an authority.
He knew the inner poignancy of every song,
the bitter humour of every tale. Speaking sober truth
about Russia he forgot that he had ever lied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly into the little open space about the hearth
emerged from the throng, a brisk, wiry man with a keen,
clean-shaven, weather-beaten face, who, on catching sight
of Triona, paused for a startled second and then darted
up to him with outstretched hand; and Triona, taken off
his guard, made an eager step to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, for two days, you have faced death alone with a man
who has given every proof of indomitable courage and
cheerfulness, your heart has an abominable way of leaping
when suddenly, years afterwards, you are brought with
him face to face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are Briggs! I knew I was right. Fancy running
up against you here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona’s cheeks burned hot. The buried name seemed
to be shrieked to the listening universe. At any rate,
Olivia heard; and instinctively she drifted from the side
of Colonel Onslow towards Alexis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a far cry from Russia,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and a far cry from the lower deck of an armoured
car,” laughed the other. “Well, I am glad to see you.
God knows what has happened to the rest of us. I’ve
been one of the lucky ones. Got a ship soon afterwards.
Retired now. Farming. Living on three pigs
and a bee. And you”—he clapped him on the shoulder—“you
look flourishing. I used to have an idea there
was something behind you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that Triona became conscious of Olivia at
his elbow. He put on a bold face and laughed in his
careless way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have my wife behind me. My dear—this is Captain
Wedderburn. We met in Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did more than meet, by George!” cried Wedderburn
breezily. “We were months together in the Column——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Column?” asked Olivia, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Armoured Car Column. I forget what the humour
of war rated him as. Able Seaman, I think. I was
Lieutenant then. It was a picnic, I assure you. And
there were the days—he and I alone together—I’ll never
forget ’em—we got cut off—but he has told you all about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. Briggs——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me,” Alexis interrupted hastily. “But that’s
not my name. It was literally a <span class='it'>nom de guerre</span>. My real
name is Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” Wedderburn put his hands on his narrow hips
and stared at him. “The famous chap I was asked to
meet to-night? Mrs. Triona, your husband is a wonderful
fellow. The months that were the most exciting time
in my life, anyhow, he hasn’t thought it worth while mentioning
in his book. And yet”—his keen eyes swept like
searchlights over the other’s face—“you were knocked
out. I remember the day. And you must have been a
long time in hospital. How the deuce did you manage
to work everything in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only scratched,” said Triona. “A week or
two afterwards I was back in the Russian service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Wedderburn with unexpected frostiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to greet a woman of his acquaintance standing
near, and husband and wife were left for a few seconds
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never told me about serving with the British
forces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just an interlude,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hostess came up and manœuvred them apart.
Dinner was announced. The company swept downstairs.
Olivia sat between her host and Colonel Onslow, Lady
Aintree opposite, and next her, Captain Wedderburn.
For the first time in her married life Olivia suffered
vague disquiet as to her husband’s antecedents. The
rugged-faced, bright-eyed man on the other side of the
table seemed to hold the key to a phase of his life which
she had never heard. She wished that he were seated
elsewhere, out of sight. It was with a conscious effort
that she brought herself to listen intelligently to her host
who was describing his first meeting with the now famous
Alexis Triona, then valiantly driving hireling motor-cars
under the sobriquet of John Briggs. She felt a touch
of ice at her heart. For the second time that night she
had heard the unfamiliar name. Alexis had told her, it
is true, of his early struggles in London while writing
<span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span>, but of John Briggs he had
breathed no word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk drifted into other channels until she turned to
her neighbour, Colonel Onslow, who after a while said
pleasantly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m looking for an opportunity of a chat with your
husband, Mrs. Triona. From his book, he seems to have
covered a great deal of my ground—and it must have been
about the same time. It’s strange I never came across
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so,” she replied. “His Secret Service
work rather depended on his avoidance of other European
agents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Onslow yielded laughingly to the argument.
Of course, that was quite understandable. Every man
had his own methods. No game in the world had more
elastic rules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the other hand, I knew a Russian on exactly the
same lay as your husband, a fellow Krilov, a fine chap—I
ran into him several times—who was rather keen on
taking me into his confidence. And one or two of the
things he told me were so identical with your husband’s
experiences, that it seems they must have hunted in
couples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, he was on his own, I assure you,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow, I’m keen to meet him,” said Onslow, unaware
of the growing fear behind the girl’s dark eyes. “I
only came home a month ago. Somebody gave me the
book. When I read it I went to my friend Rowington
and asked about Alexis Triona. That’s how I’m here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, noticing her air of constraint, he said apologetically,
“You must be fed up with all this ancient history.
A wanderer like myself is apt to forget that the
world is supposed to be at peace and is even rather bored
with making good the damage of war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia answered as well as she could, and for the rest
of the interminable meal strove to exhibit her usual gay
interest in the talk around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her heart was heavy with she knew not what forebodings.
She could not see Alexis, who was seated on the
same side and at the other end of the long table. She
felt as though the benevolent gold-spectacled man had
deliberately convened an assembly of Alexis’s enemies.
It was a blessed relief when the ladies rose and left the
men; but in the drawing-room, although she was talking
to Lady Aintree, most winningly gracious of women, her
glance continuously sought the door by which the men
would enter. And when they came in his glance, for
the first time in their married life, did not seek or meet
hers. She scanned his face anxiously. It was pale and
drawn, she thought, and into his eyes had crept the furtive
look of a year ago which happiness, she thought, had dispelled
for ever. He did not come near her; nor did
Wedderburn and Onslow; nor did the two latter talk to
him; he was swallowed up in a little group at the further
end of the room. Meanwhile, the most up-to-date thing
in bishops sank smilingly into a chair by her side, and
ridden by some ironical Imp of the Inapposite described
to her a visit, in the years past, to the Castle of Schwöbbe
in Hanover, where dwelt the Baron von Munchausen, the
lineal descendant of the famous liar. A mythical personage?
Not a bit. Munchausen was one of Frederick
the Great’s generals. He had seen his full-length portrait
in the Rittersaal of the old Schloss. Thence he began
to discourse on the great liars of travel. Herodotus,
who was coming more and more into his own as a faithful
historian; John Mandeville; Fernando Mendez Pinto,
a name now forgotten, but for a couple of centuries a byword
of mendacity; Gemelli Carreri, the bed-ridden Neapolitan
author of a <span class='it'>Voyage Round the World</span>; the Rabbi
Benjamin of Tudela who claimed to have ridden a
hippogriff to the tomb of Ezekiel; George Psalmanazar,
who captivated all London (including so level-headed a
man as Samuel Johnson) with his history of the Island
of Formosa and his grammar of the Formosan language;
de Rougemont, the turtle-riding impostor of recent years;
and the later unfortunate gentleman whose claim to have
discovered the North Pole was so shockingly discredited.
The bishop seemed to have made a hobby of these perverters
of truth and to look on them (as in theological
duty bound), wriggling through the lake of fire and brimstone,
in the light of Izaak Walton’s counsel concerning
the worms threaded on the hook, as if he loved them.
Then there were the notorious Blank and Dash and Dot,
still living. Types, said he, of the defective criminal
mind, by mere chance skirting round the commonly recognized
area of crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, with nerves on edge, welcomed the matronly
swoop of Mrs. Rowington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Bishop, I want to introduce you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose, made a courtly bow to Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll read your lordship’s next book of travel with great
interest,” she said.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>As the home-bound taxi drove off:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank goodness that’s over,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She echoed with a sigh: “Yes, thank goodness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the bores of the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you have a talk with Colonel Onslow?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The biggest of the lot. I’m sick to death of the Caucasus,”
he added with unusual irritation. “I wish I
had never been near it. I hate these specially selected
dinner parties of people you don’t want to meet and will
never meet again.” He took her hand, which was limp
and unresponsive. “Did you have a rotten time, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we hadn’t gone,” she replied, withdrawing her
hand under the pretext of pulling her cloak closer round
her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rolled and lit a cigarette and smoked gloomily. At
last he said with some impatience:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I didn’t mention the little episode with the
British Force. It would have been out of the picture.
Besides, nothing very much happened. It was a stupid
thing to do—I had no right. That’s why I took an assumed
name—John Briggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you used it when you landed in England. Mr.
Rowington told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, dear. Alexis Triona, chauffeur, would have
been absurd, wouldn’t it?” He turned to her with the
old eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time it was she who thrust out a caressing hand,
suddenly feeling a guilty horror of the doubts that had
beset her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would tell me everything about yourself—the
details you think so unimportant. Then I wouldn’t
be so taken aback as I was this evening, when Captain
Wedderburn called me Mrs. Briggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll write you a supplementary volume,” said he, “and
it shall be entitled <span class='it'>Through Love and Sunshine</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ring in his voice consoled her. He drew her close
to him and they spoke little till they reached their house.
There, in the dining-room, he poured out a stiff whisky-and-soda
and drank it off at a gulp. She uttered a
startled, “My dear!” at the unusual breach of abstemious
habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m dog-tired,” said he. “And I’ve things to do before
I go to bed. Don’t wait for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night has given me an idea for a story. I must
get it, dear, and put it down; otherwise—you know—I
shan’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She protested. His brain would be fresher in the morning.
Such untimely artistic accouchment had, indeed,
happened several times before, and, unless given its natural
chances had occasioned a night of unrest; but never
before had there been this haggardness in his face and
eyes. Again the doubts assailed her. Something that
evening had occurred to throw him off his balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If anything’s worrying you, dear, do tell me,” she
urged, her clasp on the lapels of his dress-coat and her
eyes searching his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her wrists, kissed her, and laughed, as she
thought, uneasily. Worries? He hadn’t an anxiety in
the world. But this idea—it was the germ of something
big. He must tackle it then and there. Led, his arm
around her body, to the door, she allowed herself to be
convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you go to sleep. You must be tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone, Triona poured himself out another whisky
and soda. In one evening he had suffered two shocks, for
neither of which his easy nature had prepared him. The
Wedderburn incident he could explain away. But from
the blind alley into which he was pinned by Colonel Onslow,
there had been but a horrible wriggling escape. It
was a matter, too, more spiritual even than material.
He felt as though he had crawled through a sewer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to his desk by the window, and from a drawer
took out his despatch case, which he unlocked with the
key that never left his person; and from it he drew the
little black book. There, half-erased, in pencil on the
reverse of the cover, was the word, in Russian characters,
“Krilov.” Hitherto he had regarded this as some unimportant
memorandum of name or place. It had never
occurred to him that it was the name of the owner of the
diary. But now, it stared at him accusingly as the signature
of the dead man whose soul, as it were, he had
robbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Krilov. There was no doubt about it. Onslow had
known him, that fine-featured grizzled-haired dead man,
in his vehement life. He had heard from his lips the wild
adventures which he had set down with such official
phlegm in the little black book, and which he, Alexis
Triona, had credited to himself, and had invested with the
wealth of his poet’s imagination. Of course, he had
lied, on his basis of truth, to Colonel Onslow, disclaimed
all knowledge of Krilov. It had been the essence of the
old Russian régime that secret agents should have no acquaintance
one with another. It was a common thing for
two men, unsuspectingly, to be employed on an identical
mission. The old Imperial service depended on this
system of checks. If the missions were identical, the
various incidents were bound to be similar. He had defended
his position with every sophistical argument his
alert brain could devise. He drew, as red herrings across
the track, the names of obscure chieftains known to
Colonel Onslow, whom he had not mentioned in his book;
described them—one long-nosed, foxy, pitted with smallpox;
another obese and oily; to Colonel Onslow’s mind
irrefutable evidence of his acquaintance with the country.
But as to narrated incidents he had seen puzzled
incredulity behind the Colonel’s eyes and had felt his semi-accusing
coldness of manner when their conversation
came to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He replenished a dying fire and sat down in an arm-chair,
the despatch case by his side, the book in his hands—the
little shabby black book that had been his Bible,
his mascot, the fount of all his fortunes. His fingers shook
with fear as he turned over the familiar pages. The dead
man had come to life, and terrifyingly claimed his own.
The room was very still. The creak of a piece of furniture
caused him to swing round with a start, as though
apprehensive of Krilov’s ghostly presence. He must
burn the book, the material evidence of his fraud. But
the fire was sulky. He must wait for the blaze, so that
there should be no doubt of the book’s destruction.
Meanwhile his nerves were playing him insane tricks.
His ordeal had shaken him. He sought the steadying
effect of another whisky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned back in his chair. It had been an accursed
evening. Once more he had to lie to Olivia, and this
time she appeared to be struggling with uncertainty.
There had been an unprecedented aloofness in her attitude.
Yes. He spoke the words aloud, “an unprecedented
aloofness,” at first with strange unsuccess and
then with solemn deliberation; and his voice sounded
strange to his ears. If she suspected—but, no, she could
not suspect. His head grew heavy, his thoughts confused.
The fire was taking a devil of a time to burn
up. Still, he was beginning to see his way clearer. The
whisky was a wonderful help to accurate thinking. What
an ass he had been not to recognize the fact before!
Besides—the roof of his mouth was parched with thirst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diabolical notebook had to be destroyed. But
first there must be flame in the grate. That little red
glow would do the trick. It was only a question of
patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a matter of patience, old man,” said he.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A couple of hours afterwards, Olivia, in nightdress and
wrapper, entered the room. The fire had gone out under
its too heavy load of coal. Before it sprawled Alexis,
asleep. On the small table beside him stood the whisky
decanter, whose depleted contents caused Olivia to start
with a gasp of dismay. His drunken sleep became obvious.
She made an instinctive vain effort to arouse
him. But the first pang of horror was lost in agonized
search for the reason of this amazing debauch. He, the
most temperate of men, by choice practically a drinker
of water, to have done this! Could the reason lie in
the events of the evening which had kept her staringly
awake? She cowered under the new storm of doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the floor lay open a little dirty-paged book which
must have fallen from his hand. She picked it up,
glanced through it, could make nothing of it, for it was
all in tiny Russian script. The horrible relation between
this derelict book and the almost emptied whisky
decanter occurred to her oversensitive brain. Then came
suddenly the memory of a stupid argument of months
ago at The Point and his justification of the plagiarist.
Further, his putting of a hypothetical case—the finding on
the body of a dead man a notebook with leaves of the
thinnest paper.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She held in her hand such a notebook.
It dropped from her nerveless fingers. Suddenly
she sprang with a low cry to her husband and shook him
by the shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alexis. Alexis. Wake up. For God’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the unaccustomed drug of the alcohol held him in
stupor. She tried again, wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alexis, wake up and tell me what I think isn’t true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she realized that he would lie there until the
effect of the whisky had worn off. Mechanically, she
put a cushion behind his head and adjusted his limbs
to a position of comfort. Mechanically, too, she put the
stopper in the decanter and replaced the siphon on the
silver tray, and with her scrap of a handkerchief tried
to remove the ring which the wet siphon had made on the
table. Then she looked hopelessly round the otherwise
undisturbed and beloved room. What could be done
until Alexis should awaken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would go to bed. Perhaps she might sleep. She
felt as though she had been beaten from head to foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The despatch box lay open on the hearthrug, the key
in the lock. Its secrecy had hitherto been a jest with
her. She had sworn it contained locks of hair of Bluebeard
victims. He had given out a legend of Secret
Service documents of vast importance. Now it was
obvious that, at any rate, it was the repository of the little
black book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated on the threshold. Her instinct of order
forbade her to leave the despatch box open and the book
trailing about the floor. She would lock the book up in
it and put the key in one of Alexis’s pockets. But when,
having picked up the small leather box and carried it to
the desk, she prepared to do this, a name written on a
common piece of paper half in print—an official form—stared
brutally at her. And there were others underneath.
And reading them she learned the complete official
history of John Briggs, Able Seaman, from the time
of his joining the Armoured Column in Russia to his discharge,
after his mine-sweeper had been torpedoed in the
North Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, her dark hair falling about the shoulders of her
heliotrope wrap, sat in her husband’s writing-chair, staring
at him with tragic eyes as he slept, his brown hair carelessly
sweeping his pale brow, and kept a ghastly vigil.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>B</span><span class='sc'>LAISE OLIFANT</span> sat over his work in the room
which once, for want of a better name, the late
Mr. Gale called his study; but it was a room
transformed to studious use. The stuffed trout and the
large scale-map of the neighbourhood and the country
auctioneer’s carelessly bestowed oddments had been replaced
by cases of geological specimens and bookshelves
filled with a specialist’s library. The knee-hole writing-desk,
with its cigarette-burned edge, had joined the rest
of the old lares and penates in honourable storage, and
a long refectory-table, drawn across the window overlooking
the garden, and piled with papers, microscopes,
and other apparatus, reigned in its stead. Olifant loved
the room’s pleasant austerity. It symbolized himself,
his aims and his life’s limitations. A fire burned in the
grate, for it was a cold, raw morning, and, outside, miserable
rain defaced the April day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smoked a pipe as he corrected proofs, so absorbed
in the minute and half-mechanical task that he did not
hear the door open and the quiet entrance of a maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Triona, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words cut through the silence so that he started
and swung round in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Triona? Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the dining-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show him in here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid retired. Olifant rose and stood before the
fire with a puzzled expression on his face. Triona in
Medlow at ten o’clock in the morning? Something serious
must have brought a man, unannounced, from London
to Shropshire. His thoughts flew to Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment afterwards the dishevelled spectre of Triona
burst into the room and closed the door behind him. His
coat was wet with rain, his boots and trouser hems
muddy. His eyes stared out of a drawn, unshaven face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God I’ve found you. During the journey I
had a sickening dread lest you might be away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did you manage to get here at this hour?”
asked Olifant, for Medlow is far from London and trains
are few. “You must have arrived last night. Why the
deuce didn’t you come to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got to Worcester by the last train and put up for the
night and came on first thing this morning,” replied Triona
impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ve walked from the station. You’re wet
through. Let me get you a jacket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant moved to the bell, but Triona arrested him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no. I’m taking the next train back to London.
Don’t talk of jackets and foolery. I’ve left Olivia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant made a stride, almost menacing, towards him,
the instinctive gesture of his one arm curiously contrasting
with the stillness of the pinned sleeve of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I say,” cried Triona. “I’ve left Olivia. I’ve
left her for ever. I’m cutting myself out of her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re mad. Olivia——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona put up a checking hand. “Oh, no, not Olivia.”
He laughed bitterly at the indignant advocacy in Olifant’s
tone. “Olivia’s there—where she always has been—among
the stars. It’s I that have fallen. Good God!
like Lucifer. It’s I that crawl.” He caught an accusing
question in the other’s hardening eyes. “It isn’t what you
might naturally think. There’s not the ghost of another
woman. There never has been—never shall be. It’s
my only clean record. And I love her—my God! My
soul’s in Hell, aching and burning and shrieking for her.
I shall live in Hell for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant turned, and wheeling round his writing-chair
sat down and pointed to an arm-chair by the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down and tell me quietly what is the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Triona waved aside the invitation and remained
standing. “The matter is that I’m an impostor and a
liar, and Olivia has found it out. Listen. Don’t ask
questions until I’ve done. I’m here for Olivia’s sake.
You’re the only creature in the world that can understand—the
only one that can help her through. And she
couldn’t tell you. Her pride wouldn’t let her. And if it
did, the ordeal for her! You’ll be able to go to her now
and say, ‘I know everything.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to now, my dear fellow,” said Olifant, “you’ve
been talking in riddles. But before you begin, let me remind
you that there are two sides to every story. What
I mean is—get it into your head that I realize I’m listening
to your side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there aren’t two sides,” cried Triona. “You
don’t suppose I’ve come down here to defend myself!
If you see when I’ve done that I’ve had some excuse, that
there is a grain of saving grace lying somewhere hidden—all
well and good. But I’m not here to plead a case.
Haven’t I cleared the ground by telling you I’m a liar and
an impostor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant again looked searchingly at the pale and haggard-eyed
young man, his brown hair unkempt and falling
across his broad forehead, his lips twitching nervously;
and the elder man’s glance turned to one of pitying
kindness. He rose, laid his hand on the lapel of the wet
coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll take this off, at any rate. There—we’ll hang
it over the fender-seat to dry. Sit beside it and dry
your legs. It’s no good catching your death of cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona submitted to the friendly authority and sat
down in his shirt sleeves before the blaze. Olifant, aware
of the sedative value of anticlimax, smiled and offered
refreshments. Tea—coffee—a drop of something to keep
out the cold. Triona suddenly glanced at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never touch alcohol again as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cigarette, then? Olifant handed the box, held a
match. Triona smoked. Olifant re-lit his pipe and
leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let me have the plain, unvarnished tale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They smoked many cigarettes and many pipes during
the telling of the amazing story. As his life had unfolded
itself in the grimness of the little Newcastle kitchen,
so he recounted it to Olifant. In his passionate final
grip on Truth, which for the last few months of his
awakening had proved so elusive, he tried to lay bare the
vain secret of every folly and the root of every lie. The
tangled web of the hackneyed aphorism he unwove,
tracking every main filament to its centre, every cross-thread
from the beginning to end of its vicious circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plain unvarnished tale it was not in the man’s nature
to give. Even in his agony of avowal he must be dramatic,
must seize on the picturesque. Now he sat on the
narrow leather-covered fender-seat, hunched up, his eyes
ablaze, narrating the common actualities of his life; and
now he strode about the room, with great gestures of his
pink-shirted arms, picturing vividly the conflicting emotions
of his soul. First he sketched—so it seemed to the
temperamentally remote Olifant—in broad outlines of
flame, his true career. Then in strokes, like red-hot wire,
he filled in the startling details. The grizzled head and
sharp-cut features of the naked body of the dead man
Krilov in the ditch—the cold grey waste around—the finding
of the odds and ends, the glint of the pocket-compass
behind a few spikes of grass, the false teeth, the little
black book, the thing of sortilege, of necromantic influence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
spell of the book in the night watches
in the North Sea, its obsession; his pixy-led infatuation
which made him cast aside the slough of John Briggs and
sun himself in the summer of the world as the dragonfly,
Alexis Triona. In swift lines, too, of a Will-o’-the-Wisp’s
dance he revealed the course of his love. Then,
unconsciously, before the concentrated gaze of the other
man he dropped a baffling gauze curtain, as on a stage,
through which his motives and his actions appeared uncertain
and unreal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant had listened in astounded silence. His first
instinct was one of indignation. He had been unforgivably
deceived by this exterior of friendship under false
pretences. The blow dealt to unregenerate man’s innate
vanity hurt like a stab. His own clear soul rose in revolt.
The fellow’s mendacity, bewildering in its amplitude,
would have set Hell agape. He shivered at the cold
craft of his imposture; besides, he was a ghoul, a stripper
of the dead. He lost the man he had loved in a new
and incomprehensible monster. But as Triona went on
he gradually fell under the spell of his passionate remorse,
and found himself setting the human against the
monstrous and wondering which way the balance would
turn. And then he became suddenly aware of the impostor’s
real and splendid achievements, and he stood in pitiful
amaze at the futility of the unnecessary fraud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why, in God’s name? Why?” he cried, staring
through the baffling curtain. “A man of genius, you
would have held your own without all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could have done nothing without the help of that
damned little black book. Don’t you see how the necromancy
of the thing gripped me—how it has got its diabolical
revenge? I told you not to ask me questions,” Triona
burst out fiercely. “You’re trying to make me defend
myself.” He swung away, then laughed mirthlessly.
“There seems to be a poetic justice in life. This
room in which we have spent so many hours—it’s filled
from floor to ceiling with my lies. Now I come with
Truth, a sort of disinfectant. Perhaps I was driven back
just to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant knitted a perplexed brow. Such fantastic psychologies
were beyond his simple scientific habit of mind.
He said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me you came here on account of Olivia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—I must ask you again the same everlasting
‘Why?’ How could you dare to marry her with this lie
on your soul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. How dared I?” said Triona dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wouldn’t it have been quite simple to tell her the
truth? You could have afforded to make a clean breast of
it. You had proved yourself a remarkable man, apart
from—from the Triona myth. And she is big enough to
have stood it. Why, in God’s name, didn’t you trust
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona threw out his hands helplessly. He did not
know. Again he pleaded the unseen power that had
driven him. When he had tried to resist, it was too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now you think me a fool and a knave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re a fool,” said Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not a scoundrel? I should like to know. You
were the first man who really held out the hand of
friendship to me. Till then people regarded me as an
interesting specimen. You took me on my human side.
I shall never forget coming to your sister’s house at Oxford.
It was a new and wonderful atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is so,” said Olifant, “why didn’t it compel
confidence—something of the real truth? I see you now
telling my sister and myself your fairy tale; in the same
fervid way as you’ve been telling me the truth this
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona rose and put on his jacket which now was dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I hope to make you understand, when I
don’t understand myself? Besides,” he flashed, after
shrugging himself impatiently into the garment, “haven’t
I said I wasn’t seeking condonation or sympathy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You asked me whether I thought you a scoundrel,”
said Olifant quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, do you? Say I am, and have done with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I did, I don’t see what good it would do,” replied
Olifant, a vague comprehension of this imaginative alien
soul dawning on his mind. “You’re out for penance in
the same crazy way you’ve been out for everything else.
So you hand me the scourge and tell me to lay on. But
I won’t. Also—if I committed myself by calling you an
unmitigated blackguard, I couldn’t give you the advice
that it’s in my heart to give you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To go back to Olivia and do your penance with her by
telling and living the truth. <span class='it'>Magna est veritas et prævalebit.</span>
Especially with a woman who loves you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona turned to the table by the window and stared
out into the rain-swept garden, and the vision of a girl
horror-stricken, frozen, dead, rose before his eyes. Presently
he said, his back to the room:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean kindly and generously. But it’s impossible
to go back. The man, Alexis Triona, whom she loved,
has melted away. He never had real existence. In his
place she sees a stranger, one John Briggs, whom she
loathes like Hell—I’ve seen it in her eyes. She feels
as if she had been contaminated by contact with some unclean
beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant sprang from his chair and, catching him by the
shoulder, swung him round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You infernal fool, she doesn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know better,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m beginning to think I know <span class='it'>her</span> better,” Olifant
retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—that is possible,” said Triona. “You’re of
her caste. I’m not. I’ve pretended to be, and that’s
how I’ve come to grief. You’re a good fellow, Olifant,
straight, just like her; and neither of you can understand
the man who runs crooked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crooked be damned!” exclaimed Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all his condemnation of self-accusing epithets
could not dissuade the fate-driven young man from his
purpose. Triona repeated the original intention of his
visit: to put Olifant in complete possession of facts which
Olivia’s pride might not allow her to reveal, and to
charge him, thus equipped, with Olivia’s immediate welfare.
At last he burst out again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man alive! Don’t torture me. All the devils in Hell
are doing it, and they’re enough for any man. Have
some imagination! Think what it would mean to her to
have me crawling about in her path for ever and ever.
When love is dead it’s dead. There’s no resurrection.
She loved Alexis Triona. Won’t you ever understand?
He’s dead. The love’s dead. If I stayed with her, I
should be a kind of living corpse to which she’s tied.
So I’m going away—out of her life altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just out into the spaciousness of the wide world,”
replied Triona with a gesture. He looked suddenly at
his wrist watch. “Good Lord!” he cried. “I’ve only
just time to catch my train. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” said Olifant. “Do you think it fair
on a woman? While you disappear for ever into spaciousness
she’ll remain none the less married—tied to you
for the rest of her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t let her worry about that!” cried Triona.
“I’ll soon be dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sped to the door. Olifant clutched at him and for
a while held fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind trains. You’ll stay here to-day. I can’t
let you go—in this hysterical state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Triona wrenched himself free. A one-armed man
is at a physical disadvantage in a struggle with a wiry two-armed
opponent. Olifant was pushed staggering back,
and, before he could recover himself, Triona had flashed
from the room, and a moment later the clang of the front
door told him he had left the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant, after a moment’s reflection, went to the telephone
and gave a London number. Then he drew his
chair nearer the fire and re-lit his pipe and waited for the
call to come through. Work was impossible. He was
in no mood to enter into the gaiety of printers in their
dance through the dead languages with which his biological
pages were strewn. His heart was exceeding heavy.
He stared into the fire and thought of what might have
been, had he not been a fool. At any rate, she would
have been spared misery such as this. He had loved
her from the moment she had opened that untouched
room upstairs, and the delicate spirit of one that was
dead had touched them with invisible hands. And he had
been a fool. Just a dry stick of a tongue-tied, heart-hobbled,
British fool. It had only been when another,
romantic and unreticent, had carried her off that he realized
the grotesqueness of his unutterable pain. Well,
she was married, and married to the man to whom he had
given his rare affection; and, folly of follies, all his intimacy
with her had grown since her marriage. She
was inexpressibly dear to him. Her hurt was his hurt.
Her happiness all that mattered. And she loved her madman
of a husband. Deep down in her heart she loved
him still, in spite of shock and disillusion. Of that he was
certain. He himself forgave him for his wild, boyish
lovableness. Olivia abandoned—it was unthinkable!</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an eternity the telephone bell rang. He leaped
up. Eventually came the faint, clear notes of a voice
which was Olivia’s. They established identities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alexis has been here. Has told me everything. He
has left here by the midday train. Of course, I don’t
know whether you want to see him; but if you do his train
gets into Paddington at six-fifteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the voice came again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I’ll meet him there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was silence.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia and Myra met the train at Paddington. But
they sought in vain for Alexis Triona. He had not
arrived in London.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> unhappy young man rushed through the train
to the railway station, goaded by the new passion
of remorse and frantic with the despair which had
driven him from the accusing horror in Olivia’s eyes.
It was only when he waited on the platform at Worcester,
where he must change to the main line, that he became
suddenly aware of loss of sanity. His suit-case, containing
all the belongings which he had taken from the
flat, was lying a mile or so away at the inn where he
had spent the night. He had not slept, not even gone
to bed, not even opened the suit-case. He had dashed
out before the inn was awake to catch the earliest morning
train to Medlow. And from that moment to this, just
as the London train was steaming in, both luggage and
unpaid bill had vanished from his mind. There was
nothing to do but go to the inn and proceed to London by
a later train. Thus, Fate had stage-managed for him
another deception of Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The realization of his crazy lapse of memory was a
sobering shock. Never before had he lost grip of himself.
Hitherto, the tighter the corner—and he had found
himself in many—the clearer had been his brain. The
consciousness of the working of a cool intellect had given
a pleasurable thrill to danger. Now, for over twenty-four
hours, he had been acting like a madman, in contemplation
of which the only thrill he experienced was one
of profound disgust. To enter whatever sphere of life
the effacement of Alexis Triona should render necessary,
raving like a maniac would be absurd. It would need all
his wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His retrieved suit-case in the rack of the third-class
carriage, the paid hotel bill in his pocket, and food, up
to then forgotten, in his stomach, he fortified himself in
this decision, until exhausted nature claimed profound
and untroubled sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He awoke at Paddington, homeless for the night. Now
his brain worked normally. Alexis Triona had disappeared
from the face of the earth. It was therefore essential
to avoid hotels where Alexis Triona might possibly
be recognized. Besides, he knew that West End
hotels were congested, that the late-comers to London had
been glad to find a couch at a Turkish Bath. His chauffeur’s
knowledge of London came to his aid. He drove
to a mouldy hotel in the purlieus of the Euston Road,
and there found a frowzy room. The contrast between
the bed, its dingy counterpane sagging into the worn
hollow of the mattress beneath, the threadbare rugs
askew on the oilcloth, the blistered deal washstand and
dressing-table, the damp, dirty paper, the bleak blinds,
and the sweet and dainty appointments of the home he
had left smote him till he could have groaned aloud.
Not that he gave a thought to such things in themselves.
Physical comfort meant little to him. But the lost
daintiness signified Olivia; this abominable room, the
negation of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat on the bed, rolled a cigarette, and began to
think clearly. That he had for ever forfeited Olivia’s
affection it never entered his head to doubt. He saw
her face grow more cold and tragic, and her eyes more
horror-stricken at every fresh revelation of mendacity.
Loathing himself, he had not pleaded for forgiveness; he
had done penance, applied the lash, blackening himself
unmercifully. He had lost sense of actual things in his
cold romance of deception. He stood before her self-proclaimed,
a monster of lies. Now he saw himself an
unholy stranger profaning the sanctity of her life. He
had fought for Heaven with Hell’s weapons, and Eternal
Justice had hurled him back into the abyss. In the
abyss he must remain, leaving her to tread the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exposure of the Vronsky myth had hurt her as
much as anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vronsky?” She put her hands, fingers apart, to her
temples. “But you made me give my heart to Vronsky!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, surely he had committed towards her the unforgivable
sin. He was damned—at any rate, in this world.
To rid her irremediably of his pestilent existence was the
only hope of salvation. Olifant was a fool, speaking
according to the folly of an honourable gentleman. He
clenched his teeth and gripped his hands. If only he
could have been such a fool! To appear the kind of
man that Olifant easily, naturally, was had been his
gnawing ambition from his first insight into gentle life,
long ago, in the Prince’s household. But, all the same,
Olifant was a fool—a sort of Galahad out for Grails, and
remote from the baseness in which he had wallowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to Olivia. She loves you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chivalrous imbecile! He had not seen Olivia’s great
staring dark eyes with rims around them, and the awful
little drawn face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right—it was the only way out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, during all this interview with Olivia, he had been
quite sane. He had indulged in no histrionics. He had
not declaimed, and flung his arms about, as he had done
in Olifant’s study. He had felt himself talking like a dead
man immersed up to the neck in the flames of Hell, but
possessed of a cold clear intellect. In a way, he was
proud of this. To have made an emotional appeal would
have obscured the issue towards which his new-found
honesty was striving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His last words to Olivia were:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the future?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said hopelessly: “Is there a future?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she drew a deep breath and passed her fingers
across her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk to me any more, for heaven’s sake. I
must be alone. I must have air. I must walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrank wide of him as he opened the door for her,
and she passed out, her eyes remote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that the poet-charlatan became suddenly
aware of his sentence. If the Avengers, or what not
uncheerful personages of Greek Tragedy had surrounded
him with their ghastly shapes and had chanted their dismal
Choric Ode of Doom, his inmost soul could not have
been more convinced of that which he must forthwith do.
He never thought of questioning the message. He faced
the absolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waiting until he heard the click of the outer door of
the flat announcing Olivia’s departure in quest of unpolluted
air, he went into his dressing-room and packed
a suit-case with necessaries, including the despatch-case
which contained his John Briggs papers and the accursed
little black book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met Myra in the hall, impassive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had told me you were going on a journey, I
would have packed for you. Does Mrs. Triona know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he. “She doesn’t. Wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left her, and returned a few moments afterwards
with a note he had scribbled. After all, Olivia must
suffer no uncertainty. She must not dread his possible
return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give that to Mrs. Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you coming back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her as at a Fate in a black gown relieved
by two solitary patches of white at the wrists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you ask me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you weren’t,” said Myra. “I know
there has been trouble to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had always stood in some awe of this efficient automaton
of a woman, who had never given him a shadow
of offence, but in whom he had divined a jealousy which
he had always striven to propitiate. But now she awakened
a forlorn sense of dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up his suit-case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has that got to do with you, Myra?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Mrs. Triona’s room was on fire and I rushed in
through the flames to save her, would you ask me what
business it was of mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artist in him wondered for a moment at her even,
undramatic presentation of the hypothesis. He could
not argue the point, however, knowing her life’s devotion
to Olivia. So yielding to the unlit, pale blue eyes in the
woman’s unemotional face, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. There is trouble. Deadly trouble. It’s all my
doing. You quite understand that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It couldn’t be anything else, sir,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so I’m going away and never coming back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved to the door. She made the swift pace or
two of the trained servant to open it for him. She stood
for a few seconds quite rigid, her hand on the door-knob.
Their eyes met. He saw in hers a cold hostility. Without
a word he passed her, and heard the door slam behind
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was when he reached the pavement, derelict on the
wastes of the world, that his nerves gave way. Until
the click of his brain at Worcester station, he had been
demented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never again,” said he.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He undressed and went to bed. It was some hours
before he could sleep. But sleep came at last, and he
woke in the morning refreshed physically, and feeling
capable of facing the unknown future. As yet he had
no definite plan. All he knew was that he must disappear.
Merely leaving Olivia and setting up for himself
elsewhere as Alexis Triona was not to be thought of.
Alexis Triona and all that his name stood for—good and
evil—must be blotted out of human ken. He must seek
fortune again in a foreign country. Why not America?
Writing under a fresh pseudonym, he could maintain himself
with his pen. Bare livelihood was all that mattered.
Even in this earthly Lake of Fire and Brimstone to
which, as a liar, he had apocalyptically condemned himself,
a man must live. During moments of his madness
he had dallied with wild thoughts of suicide. His fundamental
sanity had rejected them. He was no coward.
Whatever punishment was in store for him, good God!
he was man enough to face it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his swift packing he had seized a clump of his
headed note-paper. A sheet of this he took when, after
breakfast, he had remounted to his frowzy room, and
wrote a letter to his publishers informing them that he
was suddenly summoned abroad, and instructing them
to pay, till further notice, all sums accruing to him into
Olivia’s banking account. Consulting his pass-book, he
drew a cheque in Olivia’s favour, which he enclosed with
a covering letter to Olivia’s bankers. Then, driving to
his own bank, he cashed a cheque for the balance of some
hundreds of pounds. With this, he prepared to start life
in some new world. Restless, he drove back to his hotel.
Restless still, he obeyed the instinct of his life, and began
to wander; not about any such haunts as might be
frequented by his acquaintances, but through the dingy
purlieus of the vague region north of the line of Euston
and King’s Cross Stations.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was in a mean street in Somers Town, a hopeless,
littered street of little despairing shops, and costers’ barrows,
and tousled women and unclean children, that they
met. They came up against each other face to face, and
recoiled a step or two, each scanning the other in a puzzlement
of recognition. Then Triona cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course—you’re Boronowski.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you—the name escapes me—” the other tapped
his forehead with a fat, pallid hand “—you’re the chauffeur-mechanic
of Prince——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Briggs,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Briggs—yes. The only man who knew more than I
of Ukranian literature—I a Pole and you an Englishman.
Ah, my friend, what has happened since those days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hell of a lot,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may indeed say so,” replied Boronowski. He
smiled. “Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you, well-dressed and looking prosperous,
doing in this—” he waved a hand “—in this sordidity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona responded with a smile—but at the foreign
coinage of a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m just wandering about. And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m living here for the moment. Living is costly
and funds are scarce. I go back to Warsaw to-morrow—next
week—a fortnight——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poland’s a bit upset these days,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is why I am here—and that is why I am going
back, my friend,” said the Pole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a stout man, nearing forty, with dark eyes and
a straggly red moustache and beard already grizzled.
His grey suit was stained with wear; on his jacket a
spike of thread showing where a button was missing. He
wore an old black felt hat stuck far back on his head,
revealing signs of baldness above an intellectual forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona laughed. “Was there ever a Pole who was not
a conspirator?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say rather, was there ever a Pole who did not love
his country more than his life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I must say, you Poles are patriotic,” said
Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boronowski’s dark eyes flashed, and seizing his companion’s
arm, he hurried him along the encumbered pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you Englishmen who have lately died and
bled in millions for your country, always have a little
laugh, a little sneer, at patriotism? To listen to you,
one would think you cared nothing for your country’s
welfare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been so sure of it, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we Poles have not. For two centuries we have
not had a country. For two centuries we have dreamed
of it, and now we have got it at last, and our blood sings
in our veins, and we have no other interest on earth.
And just as we are beginning to realize the wonder of it,
we find ourselves enmeshed in German intrigue, with
our promised way to the sea blocked, with the Powers
saying: ‘No Ukraine, no Galicia,’ and with the Russian
Red Army attacking us. Ah, no. We are not so assured
of our country’s welfare that we can afford to depreciate
patriotism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here in England?” asked Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Breaking my heart,” cried Boronowski passionately.
“I come for help, and find only fair words. I ask for
money for guns and munitions for the enforcement of
the Treaty of Versailles, and they reply, ‘Oh, we can’t
do that. Our Labour Party wouldn’t allow us to do that.
But we’ll tell those naughty Bolshevists to leave you
alone.’ So I return, my mission a failure. Oh, I play a
very humble part. I do not wish to magnify myself.
Those with me have failed. We are cast on our own
resources. We are fighting for our new national life.
And as the blood in our hearts and the thought in our
brains cry ‘Poland, Poland,’ so shall the words be ever
loud in our mouths. And look. If we did not cry out,
who would listen to us? And we are crying our ‘Poland,
Poland,’ in all the Entente and neutral countries—I,
Boronowski, the most unimportant of all. Perhaps we
are voices crying in the wilderness. But one Voice, once
on a time, was heard—and revolutionized the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s voice, crying in the wilderness of the sordid
Somers Town street, awoke at any rate a responsive
chord in the sensitive creature by his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I understand,” said he. “Forgive my idle
speech. But I am in great personal trouble, and I spoke
with the edge of my lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boronowski flashed a glance at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the remedy? The remedy for silly
unhappinesses that affect you here and here—” he
swung a hand, touching forehead and heart “—the little
things——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m damned if they’re little,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my friend,” exclaimed the Pole, halting suddenly
in front of a wilting greengrocer’s shop, and holding him
by the lapel of his coat. “Procure for yourself a sense
of proportion. In the myriad of animated beings, what
is the individual but an insignificant atom? What are
your sufferings in the balance of the world’s sufferings?
Yes. Yes. Of course you feel them—the toothache, the
heartache, the agony of soul. But I claim that the individual
has a remedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” asked Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must cast off the individual, merge his pain in the
common sorrow of humanity. He must strip himself
free of self, and identify himself with a great
cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rusty virago, carrying a straw marketing bag, pushed
him rudely aside, for he was blocking the entrance to the
shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t talk here,” he said, recovering his balance.
“Do you want to talk?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much,” replied Triona, suddenly aware that
this commonplace looking prophet, vibrating with inspiration,
might possibly have some message for him, spiritually
derelict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come up to my rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Triona’s surprise, he plunged into the crowded
greengrocer’s shop, turned into an evil-smelling, basket-littered
passage at the back, mounted a couple of flights
of unclean stairs, and unlocked and threw open the door
of an untidy sitting-room looking out on to the noisy
street. He swung a wooden chair from a little deal table
strewn with paper, and pointed to a musty sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said he courteously, “is the more comfortable.
Pray be seated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked a depopulated packet of cigarettes from
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you smoke? For refreshment, I can offer you
tea—” he pointed to a spirit-lamp and poor tea equipage
in a corner. He did the honours of his mildewed establishment
with much grace. Triona accepted the cigarette,
but declined the tea. Boronowski seated himself
on the wooden chair. Having taken off his hat, he
revealed himself entirely bald, save for a longish grizzling
red fringe at the back, from ear-tip to ear-tip. The
quick rites of hospitality performed, he plunged again
into impatient speech, recapitulating what he had said
before and ending in the same peroration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Salvation lies in a man’s effacement of himself, and
his identification with a great cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear man,” cried Triona feverishly, “what
great cause is there in the world for an Englishman of
the present day to devote himself to? Look at the
damned country. You’re living in it. Is there a cry
anywhere, ‘<span class='it'>England über alles?</span>’ Have you seen any enthusiasm
for any kind of idea? Of course I love my
country. I’ve fought for her on land and sea. I’ve
been wounded. I’ve been torpedoed. And I’d go
through it all over again if my country called. But my
country doesn’t call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose from the sofa and walked up and down the
little room, throwing about his arms, less like an Englishman
than his Polish host, who, keeping his eyes on him,
nodded his head in amazed approbation as he developed
his thesis—that of the fervid creature eager to fight England’s
battles, but confronted with England’s negation of
any battles to fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only positive ideal in England at the present
moment is Bolshevism. The only flag waved in this war-wearied
country is the red flag. All the rest is negative.
Not what we can do—but what we can prevent. And
you, Boronowski, a professor of history, know very well
that no Gospel of Negation has ever succeeded since the
world began. Look at me,” he said, standing before the
Pole, with wide, outstretched arms, “young, fit, with a
brain that has proved itself—I won’t tell you how—and
eager to throw my personal sufferings into the world’s
melting-pot—to live, my dear fellow, to work, to devote
myself to some ideal. I must do that, or die. It’s all
very well for you to theorize. You do it beautifully.
There’s not a word wrong in anything you say. But
what is the Great Cause that I can devote myself to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poland,” said Boronowski.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> word was like the lash of a whip. He stared
at the patriot open-mouthed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Poland,” said Boronowski. “Why not?
You want to fight for a Great Cause. Is not a free and
independent Poland the keystone of the arch of reconstructed
Europe? It is a commonplace axiom. Poland
overthrown, overrun with Bolshevism, all Europe
crumbles into dust. The world is convulsed. Fighting
for Poland is fighting for the salvation of the world.
Could there be a greater cause?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dark eyes glowed with compelling inspiration.
His outflung arm ended in a pointing finger. And Triona
saw it as the finger of Salvation Yeo in his boyhood’s
picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful, wonderful,” he said, below his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And simple. Come with me to Warsaw. I have
friends of some influence. Otherwise I should not be
here. The Polish Army would welcome you with open
arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona thrust out a sudden hand, which the other
gripped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God!” he cried, “I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour afterwards, his brain dominated by the new
idea, he danced his way through the melancholy streets.
Here, indeed, was salvation. Here he could live the life
of Truth. Here was the glorious chance—although he
would never see her on earth again—of justifying himself
in Olivia’s eyes. And in itself it was a marvellous
adventure. There would be endless days when he should
live for the hour that he was alive, without thought of
an unconjecturable to-morrow. Into the cause of Poland
he would fling his soul. Yes, Boronowski was right.
The sovereign remedy. His individual life—what did
it matter to him? All the beloved things were past and
gone. They lay already on the further side of the Valley
of the Shadow of Death. His personality was merged
into a self-annihilating creature that would henceforth
be the embodiment of a spiritual idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus for the rest of the day, and during the night, his
mind worked. Arrived in Poland, he would press for
the fiercest section of the front. The bullet that killed
him would be welcome. He would die gloriously.
Olivia should know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As John Briggs, with his papers in order, he found his
passport a simple matter. Boronowski, with whom he
spent most of his time, obtained a speedy visa at the
Polish and other Consulates. During the period of waiting
he went carefully through the contents of the suit-case
and removed all traces of the name and initials of
Alexis Triona. The little black book he burned page
by page with matches in the empty grate of his room.
When it was consumed, he felt himself rid of an evil
thing. In strange East London emporiums, unknown to
dwellers in the West End, and discovered by restless
wandering, he purchased an elementary kit for the campaign.
Much of his time he spent in Boronowski’s quarters
in Somers Town, reading propaganda pamphlets
and other literature dealing with Polish actualities.
When the Polish Army welcomed him with open arms,
they must find him thoroughly equipped. He bought
a Polish grammar, and compiled with Boronowski a
phrase-book so as to be prepared with an elementary
knowledge of the language. The Pole marvelled at his
fervour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You spring at things like an intellectual tiger,” said
he, “and then fasten on to them with the teeth of a bulldog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a quick worker when I concentrate,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for many days he concentrated, sleeping and eating
little, till his cheeks grew gaunt and his eyes bright
and haggard. In his interminable talks with Boronowski,
he concentrated all his faculties, until the patriot
would laugh and accuse him of a tigerish spring on the
secrets of his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true,” cried Triona, “it’s the soul of Poland I
want to make enter my being. To serve you to any
purpose I must see through Polish eyes and feel with a
Polish heart, and feel my veins thrill with the spirituality
of Poland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall see,” answered Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And just as he had fallen under the obsession of the
dead Krilov during the night watches in the North Sea,
so did he fall under the obsession of this new Great
Cause. Something fundamentally histrionic in his temperament
flung him into these excesses of impersonation.
Already he began to regret his resumption of the plain
name of John Briggs. Even in the pre-war Russian days
he had seldom been addressed by it. For the first social
enquiry in Russia elicited the Christian name of a man’s
father. And his father’s name being Peter, he was called
by all and sundry Ivan Petrovitch. So that even then,
in his fervent zeal to merge himself into the Russian
spirit, he had grown to regard the two downright words
of his name as meaningless monosyllables. But he
strangled the regret fiercely as soon as it arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, by heaven!” said he, “No more lies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, in spite of unalterable resolve, as he lay sleepless
with overwrought nerves in the sour room in the
Euston Road, he was haunted by lunatic Polish forms,
Brigiovski, Brigowski, which he might adopt without
breaking his vow; he could not see himself in the part
of a Polish patriot labelled as John Briggs; just as
well might a great actor seek to identify himself with
Hamlet while wearing cricketing flannels and a bowler
hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once in his talks with Boronowski did he refer
to the unhappiness to which he was to apply the sovereign
remedy. The days were passing without sign of immediate
departure. Boronowski, under the orders of his
superiors, must await instructions. Triona chafed at the
delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boronowski smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first element in devotion to a cause, or a woman,
is patience. Illimitable patience. The demands of a
cause are very much like those of a woman, apparently
illogical and capricious, but really inexorable and unswerving
in their purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very well to talk of patience,” Triona fumed,
“but when one is hag-ridden as I am——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boronowski smiled again. “<span class='it'>Histoire de femme——</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona flushed scarlet and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare you twist my words like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boronowski looked at him for a puzzled moment, seeking
the association of ideas. Then, grasping it:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, my friend,” he said courteously. “My
English, after all, is that of a foreigner. The word connection
was far from my mind. I took your speech to
mean that you were driven by unhappiness. And the
unhappiness of a young man is so often—— Again, I
beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona passed his hand through his brown hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said, “I’m sorry. Yes. If you want
to know, it’s a woman. She’s the day-spring from on
high, and I’m damned beyond redemption. The best
thing that could happen would be if she knew I were
dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boronowski tugged at his little greyish-red beard. A
follower of great causes was never the worse for having
the Furies at his heels. But he was a man of kindly
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one while he is alive can be damned beyond redemption,”
he said. “I don’t wish to press my indiscretion
further. Yet, as an older man, could I be of service to
you in any way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you’re very kind, but no one can help me.”
Then an idea flashed across his excited brain. “Not
until I’m dead. Then, perhaps, you might do something
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going to die yet, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do we know? I’m going to fight. The first
day I may get knocked out. Should anything happen to
me, would you kindly communicate with some one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved to the paper-littered table and began to
scribble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all rather premature, my friend,” said Boronowski.
“But as you wish.” He took the scrap of paper
which bore the name and address of Major Olifant.
“This I may be liable to lose. I will enter it in my notebook.”
He made the entry. Then, “May I say a serious
word to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is such a thing as the fire of purification. But—”
he put a hand on the younger man’s shoulder,
“you can’t call it down from Heaven. You must await
its coming. So we get back to my original remark. Patience,
more patience, and always patience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was consoling for the moment; but after a few
days’ further grappling with the Polish language, he
burst into Boronowski’s lodgings and found the patriot
at his table, immersed in work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we don’t start soon,” he cried, “I’ll go mad. I
haven’t slept for nights and nights. I’ll only sleep when
we are on our journey, and I know that all this is reality
and not a dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve just had orders,” replied Boronowski. “We start
to-morrow morning. Here are our tickets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, Triona wrote to Olivia. It was an eternal
farewell. On the morrow he was leaving England to
offer up his unworthy life as a sacrifice to the Great
Cause of Poland. The only reparation he could make for
the wrong he had done her was to beseech her to look
on him as one already dead. It covered many pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he returned to his musty room after this last
hour’s heart-breaking communion with her, he sat on
his bed overwhelmed by sudden despair. What guarantee
had she of this departure for Poland greater than
that of his mission to Helsingfors last summer? Would
she not throw the letter aside in disgust—another romantic
lie? He wished he had not written. He took faint
hope again on the reflection that by posting another
letter from Warsaw he could establish his veracity. But
why should he keep on worrying her with the details of
his miserable existence? Better, far better that she
should look on him as dead; better, far better that she
should believe him dead, so that she could reconstruct
her young and broken life. He might die in battle; but
then he might not. He had already carried his life safely
through battles by land and sea. Again he might come
out unscathed. Even if he was killed, how should she
hear of his death? And if he survived, was it fair that
she should be bound by law eternally to a living ghost?
Somebody had said that before. It was Olifant. Olifant,
the fool out for Grails, yet speaking the truth of
chivalry. Well, this time—he summoned up the confidence
of dismal hope—he would make sure that he was
dead and that she heard the news. At any rate, he had
prepared the ground; Boronowski would communicate
with Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a knock at his door—it was nearly midnight.
The night porter entered. A man downstairs
wished to see him—a foreigner. A matter of urgent
importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show him up,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groaned, put both his hands up to his head. He
did not want to see Boronowski to-night. His distraught
brain could not stand the patriot’s tireless lucidity of
purpose. Boronowski belonged to the inhuman band of
fanatics, the devotees to one idea, who had nothing personal
to sacrifice. Just like lonely old maids who gave
themselves up to church-going and good works, and
thereby plumed themselves on the acquisition of immortal
merit. What soul-shattering tragedy had Boronowski
behind him, any more than the elderly virgins
aforesaid? If Boronowski kept him up talking Poland
till three o’clock in the morning—as he had already done—he
would go mad. No, not to-night. The mounting
steps on the uncarpeted stairs hammered at every nerve
in his body. And when the door opened, it was not Boronowski
who appeared, but a pallid, swarthy wisp of a
man whom Triona recognized as one Klinski, a Jew,
and a trusted agent of Boronowski. He was so evilly
dressed that the night porter, accustomed to the drab
clientele of the sad hostelry, yet thought it his duty to
linger by the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona dismissed him sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” he asked in Russian, for he was
aware of the man’s scanty English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Klinski did not know. He was but the bearer of a
letter, a large envelope, which he drew from his breast
pocket. Triona tore it open. It contained two envelopes
and a covering letter. The letter ran:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sudden change in the political situation has made
it necessary for me to go—where I must not tell you.
So, to my great regret, I cannot accompany you. You,
however, will start by the morning train, as arranged.
The route, as you know, is Paris, Zurich, Saltzburg, and
Prague. I enclose letters to sound friends in Prague
and Warsaw who will relieve you of all worries and
responsibilities. If you do not hear from me in Prague,
where I should like you to remain one week—it is a beautiful
city, and the Czecho-Slovak Republic is one of the
most interesting outcomes of the war—await instructions
at Warsaw. But I anticipate picking you up in Prague.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Boronowski</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment ago, he had dreaded the interruption of Boronowski
on his nerve-racked vigil. Now the dismayed
prospect of a journey across Europe alone awoke within
him a sudden yearning for Boronowski’s society. A
dozen matters could be cleared up in an hour’s talk.
Suppose Boronowski’s return to Warsaw were indefinitely
delayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks very much,” he said. “I’ll take back the
answer to Mr. Boronowski myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can be no answer,” said Klinski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Boronowski left his lodgings early this evening,
and has gone—who knows where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona shrugged his shoulders. It was the uncomfortable
way of conspirators all the world over. To himself
he cursed it with heatedness, but to no avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you bring the letter before?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had many messages to deliver to-night, sir,”
said Klinski, “and I have not finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stunted, pallid man looked tired out, half-starved.
Triona drew from his pocket a ten-shilling note. Klinski
drew back a step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you. But in the service of my country I can
only accept payment from my Government.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona regarded him in admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a great country!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Klinski, with a light in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m proud to go and fight for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a privilege that I envy you,” said Klinski. “May
God preserve you.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Driven by the impossibility of sleep in the frowsy
room, by the incurable wander-fever which took him at
periods of unrest, he found himself an hour later standing
before the block of flats in the Buckingham Palace
Road, staring up at the windows of his home. In the
bedroom was a faint streak of light quite visible from
below through a crack in the curtains. He remembered
how, a year ago, he had been compelled by a similar
impulse, to stand romantically beneath the building which
housed her sacredness, and how the gods, smiling on him,
had delivered her into his rescuing hands. And now
there were no gods—or if there were, they did but mock
him. No white wraith would appear on the pavement,
turning to warm flesh and blood, demanding his
succour. She was up there, wakeful, behind that streak
of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood racked by an agony of temptation. The
Yale latch key was still at the end of his watch-chain.
He was her husband. He had the right of entrance.
His being clamoured for her, and found utterance in
a horrible little cry. The light invited him like a beacon.
Yes. He would cross the road. Perhaps the fool Olifant
was right. She might yet love him. And then, as
if in answer to his half-crazed imaginings, the light went
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, and walked wearily back across sleeping
London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was four o’clock when the night porter admitted
him. He stumbled to his room. As his train left Victoria
at eight, it would be an absurdity to undress and
go to bed. Utterly weary, he threw himself on it as he
was, his brain whirling. There could be no question of
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet suddenly he became conscious of daylight. He
started up and looked at his watch. It was past seven.
He had slept after all. He made a perfunctory toilet
and hurriedly completed his neglected packing. The
drowsy night porter, on duty till eight, tardily answered
his summons, and took his suit-case to the shabby vestibule.
Triona followed, with heavy great coat and canvas
kit-bag, his purchases for the campaign. The porter
suggested breakfast. There was no time. Luckily he
had paid his bill the evening before. All he demanded
was a taxi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that early hour of the morning there were none,
save a luggage-laden few bound for St. Pancras or King’s
Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t leave the hotel, sir,” said the porter, “or I
would get you one from Euston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find one, then,” said Triona, and putting on the
heavy khaki coat and gripping suit-case in one hand
and kit-bag in the other, he set off along the Euston Road.
As he neared the station entrance, he staggered along,
aching and sweating. What a fool he had been not to
foresee this idiot difficulty! What a fool he had been
to give way to sleep. He came in view of the clock.
Given a cab, he would still have time to catch the train
at Victoria. He had it on his brain that his salvation
depended on his catching the train at Victoria. He
stumbled into the outer court, past the hotel wings. An
outgoing taxi-cab swirled towards him. He dropped his
burdens and stood in its path with upheld arms. There
was a sudden pandemonium of hoarse cries, a sounding
of brakes. He glanced round just in time to see, for
a fraction of a second, the entering motor-lorry which
struck him down.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span><span class='sc'>LIVIA</span> struggled for a fortnight against Circumstance,
when Circumstance got the upper hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it had been a valiant fight from the
moment Myra, on her return to the flat, had delivered
Triona’s scribbled note, and had given her account of the
brief parting interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just as well,” she said. “It’s the only way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a brave show of dining, while Myra waited
stoically. At last, impelled to speech, she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I think of what I know nothing about?”
said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My liking has nothing to do with it,” said Myra
brushing the crumbs off the table. “If you tell me, you
tell me because it may help you. But—I know it’s not
a Christian thing to say—I’m not likely to forgive the
man that has done you an injury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has done me no injury,” said Olivia. “That’s
what I want you to know. No injury in the ordinary
sense of the word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at Myra’s impassive face, and met the
dull blue eyes, and found it very difficult to tell her, in
spite of lifelong intimacy. Yet it was right that Myra
should have no false notions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve discovered that my husband’s name is not Alexis
Triona. It is John Briggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John Briggs,” echoed Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His father was a labourer in Newcastle. He was a
chauffeur in Russia. All that he had said about himself
and written in his book is untrue. When he left us
last summer to go to Finland, he really went to Newcastle
to his mother’s death-bed. Everything he has told
me has been a lie from beginning to end. He—oh, God,
Myra——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke down and clutched her face, while her
throat was choking with dry sobbing. Myra came
swiftly round the table and put her arm about her, and
drew the beloved head near to her thin body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, my dear. You can tell me more another
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia let herself be soothed for a while. Then she
pulled herself together and rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ll tell you everything now. Then we’ll never
need talk of it again. I’m not going to make a fool of
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stiffened herself against feminine weakness. At
the end of the story, Myra asked her:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to carry on as if nothing had happened.
At any rate for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra nodded slowly. “You’re not the only one who
has had to carry on as if nothing had happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” Olivia asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but what I said,” replied Myra. “It takes
some doing. But you’ve got to believe in God and believe
in yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you get your wisdom from, Myra?” asked
Olivia wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From life, my dear,” replied Myra with unwonted
softness. And picking up the last tray of removed dinner
things, she left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next afternoon, she said to Myra, “Major Olifant
has telephoned me that Mr. Triona is arriving at Paddington
by a six-fifteen train. I should like you to
come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was characteristic of their relations that they spoke
not a word of Triona during their drive to the station
or during their wait on the platform. When the train
came in, and they had assured themselves that he had
not arrived—for they had taken the precaution to separate
and each to scan a half-section—they re-entered
their waiting taxi-cab and drove home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I shall never see him again,” said Olivia,
humiliated by this new deception. “He told Major
Olifant he was coming straight to town by the train.
The truth isn’t in him. You mustn’t suppose,” she
turned rather fiercely to Myra, “that I came to meet him
with any idea of reconciliation. That’s why I brought
you with me. But people don’t part for ever in this
hysterical way. There are decencies of life. There are
the commonplace arrangements of a separation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She burned with a new sense of wrong. Once more
he had eluded her. Now, what she told Myra was true.
She wished never to see him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaise Olifant came up to town, anxious to be of service,
and found her in this defiant mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s impossible for it all to end like this,” he said.
“You are wounded to the quick. He’s in a state of crazy
remorse. Time will soften things. He’ll come to his
senses and return and ask your forgiveness, and you will
give it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She replied, “My dear Blaise, you don’t understand.
The man I loved and married doesn’t exist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man of genius exists. Listen,” said he. “After
he left me, I’ve done scarcely anything but think of the
two of you. He could have put forward a case—a very
strong case—but he didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what was his strong case?” she asked bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant put before her his reasoned apologia for the
life of Triona. Given the first deception practised under
the obsession of the little black book acting on a peculiarly
sensitive temperament, the rest followed remorselessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was being blackmailed by one lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My intelligence grasps what you say,” Olivia answered,
“but my heart doesn’t. You’re standing away
and can see things in the round. I’m in the middle of
them, and I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she, although his wife, had stood away; if she had
been dissociated from his deceptions; if nothing more
had occurred than the exposure of the Triona myth, she
might have forgiven him. But the deceptions had been
interwoven with the sacred threads of her love; she could
not forgive that intimate entanglement. To a woman
the little things are as children, as the little ones whose offenders
Christ cursed with the millstone and the sea.
She had lain awake, his forgotten wrist-watch on her
arm, picturing him tossed by the waves of the North Sea
in the execution of her country’s errand. She had
proudly told a hundred people of the Bolshevist gyve-marks
around his ankle. She had been moved to her
depths by the tragical romance of the fictitious Vronsky.
In her heart there had been hot rebellion against a Foreign
Office keeping strangle-hold on a heroic servant and
restricting his freedom of action. These little sufferings
he had caused her she could not forgive. While inflicting
them, he knew that she suffered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In vain did Olifant, unversed in the psychology of
woman, plead the cause of the erratic creature that was
her husband. In vain did he set out his honourable and
uncontested record; that of a man whose response to the
call of duty was unquestioned; of whose courage and
endurance she had received personal testimony; who had
cheerfully suffered wounds, the hardships of flight
through Revolutionary Russia, the existence on a mine-sweeper
on perilous seas ending in the daily dreaded
catastrophe; the record of a man who, apart from his
fraud, had justified himself as a queer, imaginative
genius, writing of life in a new way, in a new, vibrating
style that had compelled the attention of the English-speaking
world. In vain did he adduce the boyish charm
of the man. Olivia sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know him as you see him,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what can I do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook a despairing head. “Nothing, my dear
Blaise.” She rubbed the palm of one hand on the back
of the other, and turned her great dark eyes on him.
“You can’t do anything, but you’ve done something.
You’ve shown me how loyal a man can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He protested vaguely. “My dear Olivia .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true,” she said. “And I’ll always remember it.
And now, don’t let us ever talk about this again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you will,” said he. “But what are you going to
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She replied as she had done to Myra. She would carry
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders. She would carry on indefinitely.
To act otherwise would open the door to
gossip. She was not going to be done to death by
slanderous tongues. She rose and stood before him in
slim, rigid dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can’t out-brave the world, I’m a poor thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stay here, then?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Where else should I go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came with a little note from my sister,” said Olifant,
drawing a letter from his pocket and handing it to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia read it through. Then she said, in a softened
voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a dear, kind friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my sister,” he smiled; but he could not keep an
appeal out of his eyes. “Why shouldn’t you?” he asked
suddenly. “It will be hateful for you here, for all your
courage. And you’ll be fighting what? Just shadows,
and you’ll expend all your strength in it. What good will
it do you or anybody? You want rest, real rest, of body
and soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I look so woebegone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sight of you now is enough to break the heart of
any one who cares for you, Olivia,” he said soberly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s merely a question of sleeplessness. That’ll pass
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will pass off quicker in the country,” he urged. “It
will be a break. The house will be yours. Mary and I,
the discreetest shadows. You don’t know the self-effacing
dear that Mary is. Besides, she is one of those
women who is a living balm for the wounded. To look
at her is to draw love and comforting from her.” He
ventured the tips of his fingers on her slender shoulders.
“Do come. Your old room shall be yours, just as you
left it. Or the room I have always kept sacred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood by the fireplace, her arm on the mantelshelf,
looking away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or, if you like,” he went on, “we’ll clear out—we
only want a few days—and give you back your old
home all to yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched out a groping hand; he took it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you would,” she said. “It’s—it’s beautiful
of you. I’m not surprised, because—” she swayed head
and shoulders a bit, seeking for words, her eyes away
from him, “—because, after that first day at Medlow, I
have never thought of you as doing otherwise than what
was beautiful and noble. It sounds silly. But I mean
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She withdrew her hand and walked away into the room,
her back towards him. He strode after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s foolishness. I’m only an ordinary, decent sort
of man. In the circumstances, good Lord! I couldn’t
do less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faced him in the middle of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I as an ordinary, decent woman, couldn’t do less
than what I’ve said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood for a few seconds eye to eye. A faint
colour came into her cheeks, and she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t suppose I’m not tempted. I am. But if I
came, you’d spoil me. I’ve got to fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This valiant attitude he could not induce her to abandon.
At last, with a pathetic air of disappointment, he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can help you in any other way, and you won’t
let me, I shall be hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll let you,” she cried impulsively. “You may
be sure. Who else is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went away comforted. Yet he did not return to
Medlow. These early days, he argued, were critical.
Anything might happen, and it would be well for him to
remain within call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of what the future held for her she did not think.
Her mind was concentrated on the struggle through the
present. She received a woman caller and chattered
over tea as though nothing had happened. The effort
braced her, and she felt triumphant over self. She went
about on her trivial shopping. She remembered a fitting
for a coat and skirt which she had resolved to postpone
till after the projected motor jaunt. If she was to live
in the world, she must have clothes to cover her. One
morning, therefore, she journeyed to the dressmaker’s
in Hanover Street, and, the fitting over, wandered through
the square, down Conduit Street into Bond Street. At
the corner, she ran into Lydia, expensively dressed,
creamy, serene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, you’re looking like a ghost. What have
you been doing with yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jogging on as usual,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their acquaintance had not been entirely broken. A
few calls had been exchanged. Once Lydia had lunched
with Olivia alone in the Buckingham Palace Road. But
they had not met since the early part of the year. They
strolled slowly down Bond Street. Lydia was full of
news. Bobby Quinton had married Mrs. Bellingham—a
rich woman twice his age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way of the transgressor is soft,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mauregard was transferred to Rome. His idol, the
Russian dancer, had run off with Danimède, the fitter
at Luquin’s. Hadn’t Olivia heard?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you been living, my dear child? In a
tomb? It has been the talk of London for the past
six weeks. They’re in Paris now, and they say she lies
down on the floor and lets the little beast kick her. She
likes it. There’s no accounting for tastes. Perhaps
that’s why she left Mauregard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her serene, worldly way, she went through the
scandalous chronicles of her galley. She came at last
to Edwin Mavenna. Olivia remembered Mavenna?
She laughed indulgently. Olivia shuddered at the memory
and gripped her hands tight. Mavenna—he mattered
little. A beast let loose for a few moments from the
darkness. He was eclipsed from her vision by the boyish,
grey-clad figure in the moonlight. She scarcely
heard Lydia’s chatter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One must live and let live, you know, in this world.
He and Sydney are partners now. I hinted something
of the sort at the time. You don’t mind now, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit. Why should I?” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s really why I’ve not asked you down to our
place in Sussex. But if you don’t mind meeting him—he’s
quite a good sport really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia’s eyes wandered up and down the crowded roadway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could see an empty taxi,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a sudden horror of Lydia—a horror queerly
mingled with fierce jealousy. Why should Lydia, with
her gross materialism, be leading this unruffled existence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you in a hurry?” Lydia asked placidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve an appointment with—my dentist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get in here and wait till we see a taxi,” said
Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood in the recess of a private doorway, by the
bow-window of a print shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not looking well, my dear,” said Lydia quite
affectionately. “Marriage doesn’t seem to agree with
you. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia flashed: “Nothing’s the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s your husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was intolerable. She strained her eyes for the
little red flag of freedom. Then, as she had told her
visitor of a day or two before:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone abroad—on important business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And not taken you with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His business isn’t ordinary business,” she said instinctively.
Then she recognized she was covering him
with his own cloak. Her pale cheeks flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s it,” said Lydia smiling. “You’re a poor
little grass widow. You want bucking up, my dear. A
bit of old times. Come and do a dinner and a theatre
with us. Sydney would love to see you again. We’ll
steer clear of naughty old Mavenna——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had to stop; for Olivia had rushed across the
pavement and was holding up her little embroidered bag
at arm’s length, and the Heaven-sent taxi was drawing
up to the kerb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia followed her and stood while she entered the
cab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll come, won’t you, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll telephone,” said Olivia. She put out a hand.
“Good-bye. It has been so pleasant seeing you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia shook hands and smiled in her prosperous, contented
way. Then she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall he drive to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia had not given the matter a thought. She reflected
swiftly. If she said “Home,” Lydia would suspect
her eagerness to escape. After all, she didn’t want
to hurt Lydia’s feelings. She cried at random:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marlborough Road, St. John’s Wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a funny place for a dentist to live,” said Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyhow, it was over. She was alone in the taxi, which
was proceeding northwards up Bond Street. Of all
people in the world Lydia was the one she least had desired
to meet. Dinner and Revue. Possibly supper and
a dance afterwards! Back again to where she had
started little over a year ago. She suddenly became
aware of herself shrieking with laughter. In horror, she
stopped short, and felt a clattering shock all through her
frame, like a car going at high speed when, at the instant
of danger, all the brakes are suddenly applied. She
lay back on the cushions, panting. Her brow was moist.
She put up her hand and found a wisp of hair sticking to
her temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cab went on. Where was she? Where was she
going? She looked out of the window and recognized
Regent’s Park. Then she remembered her wildly-given
destination. She put her head through the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve changed my mind,” she said to the driver. “Go
to Buckingham Palace Mansions.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning came a letter from Lydia on expensive
primrose note-paper. Would Friday be convenient?
Sydney and herself would call for her at seven. There
was a postscript:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope the St. John’s Wood dentist didn’t hurt you too
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It gave her an idea. She replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So sorry. The St. John’s Wood dentist has made
it impossible for me to appear in public for at least a
month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She checked an impulse of laughter. She must keep
hold on herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant came in the afternoon. She told him of a
communication she had received from her bank to the
effect that Alexis had placed a large sum of money to her
account. But she did not tell him of her meeting with
Lydia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s to be done with the money? I don’t want it.
It had better be retransferred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see what I can do,” said Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came back next morning. He had seen the manager
of Triona’s bank. Nothing could be done. Alexis
had drawn out his balance in cash and closed his account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let things be—at any rate for the present,” Olifant
counselled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he took his leave, he said, looking down on her
from his lean height:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do wish you would come to Medlow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew that she was ill. She knew that she was
looking ill. But her little frame shook with an impatient
movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to stick it, Blaise. I’m going to stick it
if I die for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s magnificent, but it isn’t war—or anything else,”
said he.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Then came Rowington. The last straw. The last
straw, in the guise of an anxious, kindly, gold-spectacled,
clean-shaven, florid-faced philanthropist. First he had
asked over the telephone for Triona’s address. An urgent
matter. Olivia replied that his address was secret.
Would she kindly forward a letter? She replied that
none of her husband’s letters were to be forwarded.
Would Mrs. Triona see him, then? He would wait on
her at any time convenient to her. She fixed the hour.
He came on the stroke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, her heart cold, her brain numbed by a hundred
apprehensions, was waiting for him in the drawing-room.
Myra announced him. Olivia rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. Triona,” said he, emphasizing the conventional
handshake by laying his hand over hers and
holding it, “where is that wonderful husband of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone abroad,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must come back,” said Rowington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has gone away for a long time on important
business,” said Olivia, parrot-wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She motioned him to a chair. They sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gathered something of the sort from his letter. Has
he told you of certain dispositions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fenced. “I don’t quite follow you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This letter——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed her the letter of instructions with regard to
payment of royalties which he had received from Triona.
She glanced through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a breath of relief. “I’m glad you know. I
had a sort of idea—anyhow, no matter how important his
business is, it’s essential that he should come back at
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had a sickening prescience of the answer. The
kindly gentleman passed his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just a business complication, my dear Mrs. Triona,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose. He too, courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it to do with anything that happened on the night
of your dinner-party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Colonel Onslow and Captain Wedderburn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve come to you with all sorts of lies about
Alexis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would give ten years of my life not to wound you,
Mrs. Triona,” he said, in great distress. “I didn’t sleep
a wink last night. My honour as a publisher is involved.
But let that pass. I’m thinking more of you. You only
can help me—and your husband. These two gentlemen
have come to me with a challenge. Your husband’s good
faith. They ask ‘Is <span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span> a bona-fide
personal record?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Olivia, with her back to the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll have to prove it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will,” said Olivia proudly. “What do they propose
to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have the whole thing cleared up in public—in the
Press. My dear Mrs. Triona,” he said after a few moments’
hesitation, “don’t you see the false position I’m in?
This letter I’ve shown you—it looks like running away—forgive
me if I wound you. But on the face of it, it
does. I daren’t tell them. But of course, if Mr. Triona
comes back, he’ll be able to give all the explanation in the
world. I haven’t the remotest doubt of it—not the
remotest doubt. So, whatever his business is, you must
recall him. You see the importance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I see,” said Olivia tonelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So will you write and tell him this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth had to come out. She said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a matter of fact, I don’t know where he is. I can’t
communicate with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hated the look of incredulous surmise on Rowington’s
face. “As soon as I can, I’ll let him know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said Rowington. “You must. You see,
don’t you, that both Onslow and Wedderbum feel it to
be their public duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’re both men of decent feeling,” said Olivia.
“They wouldn’t attack a man when they knew he wasn’t
here to defend himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not, my dear Mrs. Triona,” said Rowington.
“I sincerely hope not. I’ll see them again. Indeed, I
tried to put them off the whole thing. I did my best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the exact charge they make against my husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her utmost power she would defend him. Let her
know facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He explained. There was a mysterious period of ten
months. Captain Wedderburn asserted that for four of
those months her husband was with the Armoured Column,
and for the remaining six he lay wounded in a
Russian hospital. Colonel Onslow maintained that those
ten months—he had his dates exact—are covered in the
book by Alexis Triona’s adventures in Farthest Russia—and
that these adventures are identical with those
of another man who related them to him in person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s definite, at any rate,” said Olivia. “But it’s
a monstrous absurdity all the same. My husband denied
the Russian hospital in my presence. You can tell these
gentlemen that what they propose to do is infamous—especially
when they learn he is not here. Will you give
them my message? To hit a man behind his back is not
English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowington saw burning eyes in a dead white face, and a
slim, dark figure drawn up tragically tense. He went
home miserably with this picture in his mind. For all
her bravery she had not restored his drooping faith in
Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Olivia sat, when he had left her, staring at public
disgrace. Against that she could not fight. The man
she had loved was a shadow, a non-existent thing; but
she bore his name. She had sworn to keep bright the
honour of the name before the world. And now the
world would sweep it into the dustbin of ignominy. A
maddening sense of helplessness, growing into a great
terror, got possession of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, when Myra brought in her letters,
she felt ill and feverish after a restless night. One of the
envelopes bore Triona’s familiar handwriting. She seized
it eagerly. It would give some address, so that she
could summon him back to make a fight for his honour.
But there was no address. She read it through, and then
broke into shrill harsh laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says he’s going out this morning to fight for the
sacred cause of Poland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra, who was pottering about the room, turned on her
sharply. As soon as Olivia was quieter, she sent for the
doctor. Later in the day, there came a nurse, and Myra
was banished most of the day from the beloved bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it came about that the next morning no correspondence
or morning papers were brought into Olivia’s
room. And that is why Myra, who preferred the chatty
paragraphs to leaders and political news, said nothing
to her mistress of a paragraph stuck away in the corner
of the paper. It was only a few lines—issued by the
police—though Myra did not know that—to the effect that
a well-dressed man with papers on him giving the name
of John Briggs had been knocked over by a motor-lorry
the previous morning and had been taken unconscious
to University College Hospital.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span><span class='sc'>YRA</span> stood by the screened-off bed in the long
ward and looked unemotionally at the unconscious
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said to the Sister, “that is Mr. John Briggs.
I know him intimately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a relative?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has no relatives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, in a case like this, we have to report to the
police. It’s their business to find somebody responsible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m responsible,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sister looked at the tall, lean woman, so dignified in
her well-made iron grey coat and skirt and plain black
hat, and was puzzled to place her socially. She might be
an austere lady of high degree; on the other hand, she
spoke with an odd, country accent. It was, at any rate,
nine hundred and ninety-nine to one that she was a genuine
friend of the patient; but there was the remaining one
in a thousand that she belonged to the race of cranks
not unfamiliar in London hospitals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a matter of formality,” said the Sister, “but
one must have some proof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Myra drew her bow at a venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Briggs was going abroad—to Poland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sister smiled with relief. In his pocket-book had
been found railway tickets and unsealed letters to people
in Prague and Warsaw. So long as they found some one
responsible, it was all that mattered. She proceeded to
explain the case. A broken thigh, broken ribs, and severe
concussion. Possibly internal injuries. The surgeons
could not tell, yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra scanned again the peaked bit of face beneath the
headbandages, which was all that was visible of Alexis
Triona, and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can he live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s doubtful,” said the Sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved away to the centre of the ward aisle. The
Sister talked of the accident, of the patient’s position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a rich man,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we gathered,” replied the Sister, who had in her
keeping his pocket-book, stuffed with English bank-notes
of high value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If anything should happen, you of course will let me
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name and address?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave it. The sister wrote it down on a note-pad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I see him just once more?” Myra asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went round the screen. Myra stood looking
down on the bit she could see of the man who had
brought catastrophe on her beloved. The shock of recognition,
although expected, aroused her pity. Then her
heart surged with fierce resentment. Serve the lying
rascal right. Why hadn’t the motor-lorry finished the
business right away? For all her cultivated impassivity
of demeanour, she stood trembling by the bedside,
scarcely knowing whether she wished him to die or live.
Had he crossed her path unrelated to Olivia, she would
have succumbed to his boyish charm. He had ever been
courteous, grasping with his subtle tact the nature of the
bond between her mistress and herself. So she half-loved,
half-loathed him. And yet, all this considered, it
would be better for Olivia and for himself if he were to die.
She glanced swiftly around. The Sister had been called
away for a second. She was alone behind the screen.
She knew that if she could take that bandaged head
in her gloved hands and shake it, he would die, and Olivia
would be free. She shivered at the extraordinary temptation.
Then reaction came and sped her from his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met the Sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I come again to see how he is getting on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t like him to die,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said the Sister, somewhat mystified at this negative
pronouncement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be sure we’ll do all we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Myra.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Of these proceedings, and of these conflicting emotions,
she said nothing to Olivia. Nor did she say anything of
subsequent visits to the hospital where Triona still lay
unconscious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time Olivia recovered sufficiently to dispense
with the nurse. The doctor prescribed change of air.
Olifant once more suggested Medlow, and this time she
yielded. But on the afternoon before her departure,
while they were packing, she had a strange conversation
with Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held in her hand, uncertain whether to burn it, the
last wild letter of Alexis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad he’s gone to Poland,” she said reflectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Myra, not looking up from the trunk
by which she was kneeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a man’s work, after all,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’s digging potatoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re right,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tore up the letter and threw the fragments into the
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a hell marriage can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re lucky. You’ve escaped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I?” asked Myra intent on the packing of underwear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At her tone Olivia started. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra looked up, sitting back on her heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose, dearie, you’re the only woman in
trouble in the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia moved a step towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you too in trouble, Myra?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been in trouble for the last twenty years, ever
since I left your mother’s house to be married to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia stared at her open-mouthed, lost in amazement.
This prim, puritanical, predestined spinster of a Myra——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swerved back into a chair, reeling ever so little
under this new shock. If there had been one indubitable,
solid fact in her world, one that had stood out absolute
during all the disillusions of the past year, it was Myra’s
implacable spinsterhood. Why, she had seen Myra
every day of her life, ever since she could remember,
except for the annual holiday. Yes. Those holidays,
always a subject for jest with her father and brothers
when they were alive. No one had known whither she
had gone, or when she had emerged on her reappearance.
She had never given an address—so far as Olivia knew.
And yet her plunge into the unknown had received the unquestioned
acceptance of the family. Only last November
she had gone in her mysterious way, taking, however,
only a fortnight instead of her customary month. Olivia,
Heaven knew why, had formed the careless impression
that she had betaken herself to some tabby-like Home
for religious incurables, run by her dissenting organization.
And all this time, tabby-like in another sense,
she had been stealing back to her husband. Where was
Truth in the world? She repeated mechanically:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra rose stiffly, her joints creaking, and stood before
her mistress, and perhaps for the first time in her life
Olivia saw a gleam of light in the elderly woman’s expressionless
pale blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m married. Before the end of my honeymoon,
I found he wasn’t in his right mind. I had to shut him
up, and come back to your mother. He’s alive still, in
the County Asylum. I go to see him every year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a revulsion of feeling, Olivia sprang to her feet and
held out both her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra—my dear old Myra——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra suffered the young embrace, and then gently disengaged
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There—there——” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why have you never told me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it have done you any good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have made me much more thoughtful and
considerate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never wanted thought or consideration,” said
Myra. “You have. So I say—would it have done you
any good? Not a ha’p’orth. I’ve been much more use
to you as I am. If you want to serve people, don’t go
and throw your private life down their throats. It chokes
them. You may think it won’t—but it does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why,” asked Olivia with moist eyes. “Why
should you want to serve me like that—your devotion all
these years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My duty,” said Myra. “I told you something of the
sort a while ago. What’s the good of repeating things?
Besides, there was your mother——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did mother know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra nodded. “She didn’t know I was going to be
married. I was young then, and afraid. Madam took
me out of an orphanage, and I thought I was bound for
life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He came to Medlow to do thatching. That’s
how I met him. His father, one of a large family, had
come from Norfolk to settle in the West. The Norfolk
thatchers are known all over England. It goes down from
father to son. His family had been thatchers in the
same village since the Norman Conquest. He was a fine,
upstanding man, and in his way an aristocrat—different
from the butcher’s boys and baker’s men that came to
the back door. I loved him with all my heart. He asked
me to marry him. I said ‘Yes.’ We arranged it should
be for my next holiday. Up to then, I had spent my
holiday at a seaside place connected with the orphanage.
One paid a trifle. Instead of going there, I went to his
home. It was only when the trouble came that I wrote
to your mother. She said the fewer people who knew, the
better. I came back as though nothing had happened.
Whether she told Mr. Gale or not, I don’t know. I
don’t think she did. There was a baby—but, thank
God, it was born dead. Your mother arranged it all,
so that no one should be the wiser. You yourself were
the tiniest tot. Perhaps now you see why I have a duty
towards the daughter of an angel from Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all my life——” Olivia began, but Myra interrupted
her unemotionally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t tell you any of this, because, as I said, it could
do you no good. And it’s your good I’ve lived for. One
must have something to live for, anyway. Some folks
live for food, other folks live for religion. I’d have lived
for religion if it wasn’t for you. I’ve struggled and
prayed to find the Way. Often it has been a question
of you and Jesus Christ who has called me to forsake the
vain affections of this world. And I’ve chosen you. I
may be damned in Hell for it, but I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on her knees again by the trunk, and continued
to pack dainty underwear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told you now, because it may do you good to see
that you’re not the only married woman in trouble. I’d
thank you,” she added after a pause, “to leave me alone
with this packing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as Olivia, not daring to yield the fullness of her
heart to this strange, impassive creature, lingered by the
door, Myra said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d best go, dearie, and think it out. At any rate,
you haven’t got to go through the sorrow of the baby business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether this was consolation or not, Olivia could not
decide. If there had been a child, and it had lived, it
might have been a comfort and a blessing. Nothing in
its heredity would have marked it with a curse. But still—it
would have been a lifelong link with the corporeal
man whom she had not married, from whom she shrank,
and whom she proclaimed her desire never to see again.
On the other hand, Myra’s revelation gave her strength
and restored her courage. She shuddered at the thought
of the hopeless lunatic in the County Asylum, dragging
out dead years of life. At any rate, she was married to a
living man.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Her first days in Medlow passed like a dream. The
kindest and gentlest of women, Mary Woolcombe, Olifant’s
sister, ministered to her wants. Mrs. Woolcombe,
too, had made an unhappy marriage, and now lived apart
from her husband, the depraved Oxford don. Thus,
with her hostess and Myra, Olivia found herself within
a little Freemasonry of unsuccessful wives. And one
day, when she came to think of it, she laughed out loud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might start a Home,” she said to Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only later, when she shook off the strangeness of
the dearly familiar, and grew strong enough to venture
out into the streets that she found sense of perspective.
Not so long ago had she set out on her Great Adventure—only
eighteen months. Yet in these she had gathered
the experience of eighteen years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Save for Blaise Olifant’s study, the house was little
changed. The oak settle in the hall still showed the
marks of the teeth of Barabbas, the bull-terrier pup.
The white pane in the blue and red window of the bathroom
still accused the youthful Bobby, now asleep for
ever beneath the sod of Picardy. Her own old room,
used by Mrs. Woolcombe, was practically unaltered. She
stared into it as she rambled about the house, and felt
that she had done right in not dispossessing its present
occupant. All her girlhood was contained within those
four walls, and she could not go back to it. The room
would be haunted by its inconsiderable ghosts. She preferred
her mother’s room, which, though scrupulously
kept aired and dusted, had remained under lock and key.
There, if ghosts counted for aught, would a spirit pervade
of exquisite sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Olifant had promised, she found herself in a strange,
indefinable way, again mistress of the house, although she
could take no part in its practical direction. He had
spoken truth of his sister, whom she loved at first sight.
Mary Woolcombe was plump, rosy, and brown-haired,
with her brother’s dark blue eyes. On their first evening
leave-taking, Olivia had been impelled to kiss her, and
had felt the responsive warmth of a sisterly bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do hope you feel at home,” Olifant asked one day
after lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem like guests, not hosts,” replied Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s dear of you to say so,” said Mary Woolcombe,
“but I wish you’d prove it by asking your friends to come
and see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” replied Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she flushed scarlet, and, as soon as she was alone,
she grappled with realities. And realities nearly always
have a nasty element of the ironical. She remembered
the first cloud that swept over her serene soul during
the honeymoon bliss of The Point. They had discussed
their future domicile. Alexis had suggested the common-sense
solution—“The Towers” as headquarters. She,
with the schoolgirl stigma of Landsdowne House upon her,
and possessed by the bitter memory of the nose-in-the-air
attitude of the Blair Park crocodile—eternal symbol
of social status—had revolted at the suggestion. He, the
equal and companion of princes, looked on her—and, if
his last crazy letter signified anything—looked still on
her, as the high-born lady—the Princess of his dreams.
Each, therefore, had deceived the other. She, the
daughter of Gale and Trivett, auctioneers and estate
agents, and so, by the unwritten law, cut off from the
gentry of Medlow, had undergone agony of remorse for
the sake of the son of a Tyneside operative, a boy before
the mast, a common chauffeur, a man far her inferior
in the social scale. No wonder he could not understand
her hesitancies. Her resentment against him
blazed anew. For his sake she had needlessly soiled
her soul with deceit and snobbery. It was well that he
had passed out of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I invite Mr. Trivett and Mr. Fenmarch to tea?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Woolcombe smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house is yours, dear. That’s not a Spanish
courtesy but an English fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two old gentlemen came, and Olivia entertained
them in the dining-room, as she had done on the afternoon
of her emancipation. She sat at the end of the comfortably
laid table, and the dusty Fenmarch, with the face
of an old moulting badger, drank tea, while, as before, the
stout, red-gilled Trivett drank whisky and soda with his
hot scones. This time, the latter explained that the
whisky was a treat—forbidden by Mrs. Trivett at the
domestic tea-table. They welcomed her back in the kindness
of their simple hearts. They knew nothing of her
separation from Triona. She had been ill and come down
for rest and change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you look as if you need it, my dear,” said Mr.
Trivett. “And some of your good father’s old port.
There should still be a dozen or two of Cockburn’s ‘70 in
the cellar at the present moment—unless Major Olifant
has drunk it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia laughed, for it was humorously meant. Mr.
Fenmarch in the act of raising his teacup to his lips, put
it down again with a sigh and shook his dusty head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a great wine,” he said with a look backward
into the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have a bottle up,” cried Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of polite protests, she rang for Myra, and to
Myra she gave instructions. And presently Myra,
trained from girlhood in the nice conduct of wine, appeared
with the cob-webbed bottle, white splash uppermost,
tenderly tilted in unshaking hands. Trivett took
it from her reverently while she sought corkscrew and
napkin and glasses, and when she placed the napkin pad
on the table, and Trivett took the corkscrew, Fenmarch,
with the air of one participating in a holy rite, laid both
hands on the sacred bottle and watched the extraction
of the cork as one who awaits the manifestation of the
god. The brows of both men were bent, and they held
their breaths. Then the cork came out clear and true,
and the broad red face of Trivett was irradiated by an
all-pervading smile. It faded into an instant’s seriousness
while he smelled the cork—it reappeared triumphant
as he held the corkscrew, with cork impaled, beneath
the nostrils of Fenmarch. Fenmarch sniffed and smiled
and bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Olivia, my dear——” said Trivett with a gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, understanding, held the wine-glasses. The wine
flowed clear, gold dissolved in rubies—is there a colour
on earth like the colour of old port?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! Only a sip for me,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. It was only for the sake of her health that
we let her open it—eh, Fenmarch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Fenmarch, eager on the pouring, cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t move your glass, for God’s sake, Olivia. You’ll
waste it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Trivett, with a false air of chivalry, let her off
with half a glass. Fenmarch refolded the napkin, so as to
give the temporarily abandoned bottle a higher tilt. The
two men smelled the wine. For the first time since the
awful night of disillusion, Olivia felt happy. These old
dears! It was like stuffing greedy children with chocolates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two elderly gentlemen raised their glasses and
bowed to her. Then sipped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Fenmarch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Trivett, with the knitted brow of puzzlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, suddenly the grey, badgery little man who had
never been known to laugh violently, gave Olivia the
shock of her life. He thrust his chair from the table
and smacked his thigh and exploded in a high-pitched
cackle of hilarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t taste it! He’s been drinking whisky! He
has paralysed his palate. I’ve been waiting for it!”
He beat the air with his hands. “Oh Lord! That’s
good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trivett’s fat jowl fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“——” he gasped, regardless of Olivia. “So I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moral——” cried the delighted Fenmarch. “Never
try to steal a march on your wife—it doesn’t pay, my
boy. It doesn’t pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he inhaled the aroma of the Heaven-given wine,
and drank with the serenity of the man who has never
offended the high gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, anxious to console, said to Mr. Trivett:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send you some round to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trivett spread out his great arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, it’ll have to settle. If moved, it won’t be
fit to drink for a couple of months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eventually he reconciled himself to the loss of the
subtler shades of flavour, and he shared with Fenmarch
the drinkable remainder of the carefully handled bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not for this genial orgy that Olivia had convened
the meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I owe you two dears an apology,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They protested. An impossibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” she asserted. “The last time you were here,
you gave me good advice, which I rejected, like a little
fool. I insisted on going up to London with all my money
tied up in a bundle, to seek my fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear,” said Trivett, “haven’t you found it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked from one to the other, and their wine-cheered
faces grew serious as she slowly shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to tell you something in confidence. It mustn’t
get round the town—at any rate, not yet. My husband
and I aren’t going to live together any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless my soul!” said Fenmarch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” she continued, “I’m where I was when I left
you. And I don’t want any more adventures. And if
you’d take back my bag of gold—there isn’t so much in
it now—and advise me what to do with it, I should be
very grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had cost her some sacrifice of pride to make this
little speech. She had rehearsed it; put it off and off
during the pleasant wine-drinking. She had flouted them
once for two unimaginative ancients, and now dreaded,
the possible grudge they might have against her. “If
you had only listened to us,” they might say, with ill-concealed
triumph. If they had done so, she would have
accepted it as punishment for her overbearing conceit
and for her snobbery. But they received her news with
a consternation so affectionate and so genuine that her
eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t ask me why,” she said. “It’s a complicated
story—and painful. But it has nothing whatever
to do with—with things people are divorced for. I
should like you to understand that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then surely,” said the old lawyer, “as the usual
barrier to a reconciliation doesn’t exist, there may still
be hopes——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” said Olivia. “My husband has done the right
thing. He has gone away—abroad—for ever, and has
made it impossible for me to find out his address.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Mr. Trivett, his red face growing
redder, “I don’t want to know none of your private affairs—”
he lost hold of grammar sometimes when deeply
moved “—it’s enough for me that you’re in trouble. I’ve
known you ever since you were born, and I loved your
father, who was the honestest man God ever made.” He
stretched out his great, sunglazed hand. “And so, if
old Luke Trivett’s any good to you, my dear, you can
count on him as long as he’s this side of the daisies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m your good friend, too,” said Mr. Fenmarch
in his dustiest manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had gone, Olivia sat for a long while alone
in the dining-room. And she felt as though she had returned
to the strong and dear realities of life after a feverish
wandering among shadows.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span><span class='sc'>FTER</span> this, Olivia took up her life, as she
thought, in firm hands. She had made her reparation
to her old friends. She joined the family
party of the Trivetts at dinner, and mixed with the
“homely folk” that assembled around old John Freke’s
tea table. She lived in a glow of contrition for past
snobberies. The vague story of her separation from
Triona which she had told to the two old men not sufficing
Medlow curiosity, she told what she believed to be
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband has gone to Poland to fight against the
Russian Reds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thereby she gave the impression that the cause of
the break up of her married life was the incurable adventurous
spirit of her husband. The suggestion fitted
in with the town’s idea of the romance of her marriage
and the legendary character of Alexis Triona, which had
originally been inspired by the local bookseller eager to
sell copies of Triona’s books. She herself, therefore, became
invested in a gossamer garment of mystery, which
she wore with becoming grace. Her homecoming was a
triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the days passed and brought no news of Alexis, she
grew convinced of the honesty of his last letter. His
real achievements in the past confirmed her conviction.
He was the born adventurer. It was like him to have
sought the only field of mad action open at that hour
of frantically guarded peace. He had gone to Poland.
In her heart she rejoiced. She saw him striving to burn
a past record and rise, Phœnix-like, from its ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he came back a Polish General, all over stars and
glory,” said Myra, during one of their increasingly intimate
conversations, “would you take up with him again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia reddened. “I should be glad for his sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see that you’re answering my question,” said
Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told you once and for all,” flashed Olivia, “that
I’ll have nothing more to do with him as long as I
live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She meant it with all that she knew of her soul. His
fraud was unforgivable; his perfect recognition of it constituted
his only merit. In Poland, doing wild things,
he was a picturesque and tolerable personage. In her
immediate neighbourhood, he became once again a repellent
figure. As far as she could, she blotted him out of
her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The threat of exposure at the hands of Onslow and
Wedderburn still hung over her head. The disgrace of
it would react on her innocent self. The laughter of the
Lydian galley rang in her ears. She guessed the cynical
gossip of the newer London world. That was hateful
enough. She need never return to either. But it would
follow her to Medlow. She would be pitied by the Trivetts
and the Frekes, and the parents of the present
generation of Landsdowne House. They would wonder
why, in the face of the revelations, she still called herself
“Mrs. Triona.” To spring her plain Mrs. Briggs-dom on
Medlow she had not the courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took counsel with Blaise Olifant. In his soldier-scholar
protecting way he seemed a rock of refuge. He
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Write to them through Rowington and ask them to
hold their hands until you can put them into communication
with your husband, which you give your word of
honour to do as soon as you learn his address.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so. The bargain was accepted. When she received
Rowington’s letter, she danced into Olifant’s study,
and, sitting on the corner of his table, flourished it in his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the relief of it! I feel ten years younger. I
was on the verge of becoming an old woman. Now it
will never come out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant leaned back in his chair and looked at her wistfully.
A faint flush coloured her cheeks, and her eyes
were lit with the gladness of hundreds of days ago. Her
lips were parted, showing the white, girlish teeth. Sitting
there, vividly alive, in the intimate attitude, smiling
on him, she was infinitely desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he. “It will never come out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cloud passed over her face. “Still, one never
knows——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have faith in Alexis,” said he. “He’s a man of his
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re the loyalest creature that ever lived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised a deprecating hand. “I would I were,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?” she asked pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were,” said he, his nose seeming to lengthen over
the wry smile of his lips, “if I were, I would go out into
the world and not rest till I brought him back to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slid to her feet. “With a barber’s basin for a
helmet, and the rest of the equipment. If you did such
an idiot thing, I should hate you. Don’t you understand
that he has gone out of my life altogether?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is a long, long time to look forward to, for a
woman so young as yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean, I might fall in love with somebody else,
and there would be horrid complications?” She laughed
in the cocksureness of youth. “Oh, no, my dear Blaise.
Once bitten, twice shy. Three times, four times, all the
multiplication table times shy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though impelled by primitive instinct, he could not
press her further. He found himself in a position of
poignant absurdity, compensated by the sweetness of their
daily companionship. Sometimes he wondered how it
could be that an awakened woman like Olivia could remain
in calm ignorance of his love. Yet she gave never
a sign of knowledge. She accepted friendship with full
hands and gave it with full heart. Beyond that—nothing.
From his sensitive point of view, it was all for the
best. If, like a lean spider, he sat down beside her and
talked of love, he would indubitably frighten Miss Muffet
away from Medlow. Further, she would hold him in
detestation for intentions which, in the queer circumstances,
had no chance of being what the world calls
honourable. He therefore put up with what he could get.
The proclamation of her eternal man-shyness sounded
like her final word on her future existence. So he came
back to Rowington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad that’s all settled,” said he. “Now you can
take up the threads of life again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think I can make of them?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t sit here idle all my life—not here, at ‘The
Towers,’ ” she laughed, “for I’m not going to inflict myself
on you for a lifetime—but here, in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no practical suggestion to make; but he spoke
from the sincerity of his tradition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman like you fulfils her destiny by being her
best self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But being good is scarcely an occupation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “I give it up, my dear. If you like, I
can teach you geology——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. Geology had to do with dead things.
She cared not a hang for the past. She wanted to forget
it. The epoch of the dynosaurus and the period of the
past year were, save for a few hundreds of centuries, contemporaneous.
No past, thank you. The present and
the future for her. The present was mere lotus-eating;
delightful, but demoralising. It was the future that mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only you were an astrologer, and could bind me
apprentice,” she said. “No,” she added after a pause.
“There’s nothing for it. I must do something. I think
I’ll go in for Infant Welfare and breed bull-dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched him as he laboriously stuffed his pipe
with his one hand by means of a little winch fixed to the
refectory table and lit it by a match struck on a heavy
mat stand; refraining from helping him, although all the
woman in her longed to do so, for she knew his foibles.
The very first time he had entered the house, he had refused
her offer of help with his Burberry. He needed a
woman to look after him; not a sister; not a landlady-lodger
friend; a wife, in fact, whose arm and hand he
would accept unquestionably, in lieu of his own. A great
pity sprung in her heart. Why had no woman claimed
him—a man stainless in honour, exquisite in thought,
loyal of heart, and—not the least qualification for the
perfect gentle knight in a woman’s eyes—soldier-like
in bearing? There was something missing. That was
all the answer she could give herself. Something intangible.
Something magnetic, possessed by the liar
and scamp who had been her husband. She could live
with Blaise Olifant for a hundred years in perfect amity,
in perfect sympathy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but with never a thrill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew well enough the basis of sentiment underlying
his friendship. If she were free to marry, he would
declare himself in his restrained and dignified way.
But with the barrier of the living Alexis between them,
she laughed at the possibility of such a declaration. And
yet, her inward laughter was tinged with bitterness.
What kind of a man was it, who, loving a woman, did
not catch her round the waist and swing her on his horse
and ride away with her? Of course, she herself would
have something to say in the matter. She would fight
tooth and nail. She would fling the ravisher to Kingdom
Come. But still her sex would have the gratification
of being madly desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some such confused way, she thought; the horror
of Mavenna, and the romantic mastery of Alexis arising
in comparison and contrast. To say nothing of Bobby
Quinton.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how you can put up with me,” she said when
he had set his pipe comfortably going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put up with you? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I are so different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had some glimmer of the things working behind her
dark eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you still want adventures? Medlow is too dull
for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt guilty, and cried impulsively: “Oh, no, no.
This is peace. This is Heaven. This is all I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for a time she persuaded herself that it was so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there came a day when the lilac and the laburnum
were out in the garden behind the house, and the row of
beeches screening it from the east wind were all a riot
of tender green, and Olivia was sitting with a book in the
noon sunshine; and the book lay unread on her lap, for
her thoughts went back to a magical day of greenery in
Richmond Park; an imperishable memory. Her eyes
filled with tears. For a few moments, she had recaptured
the lost Alexis in that remembered hour of blue mist
and mystery. And now, he was in Poland. Doing
what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French window of Olifant’s study opened, and he
came down the gravelled path towards her, a letter in
his hand. His face was serious. She rose to meet
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether I ought to show you this—but,
perhaps later you might blame me if I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She uttered a little cry which stuck in her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alexis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eagerness with which she grasped the letter brought
a touch of pain into his eyes. Surely she loved the man
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid it gives less than news of him,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, already reading the letter, she gave no heed to
his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter was from Warsaw, and it ran:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I was commissioned by my friend, Mr. John
Briggs, to communicate with you should anything befall
him. Now something must have befallen him, because
he has failed to keep with me very definite engagements
into which he had entered with the utmost good faith
and enthusiasm. He was to start on his journey hither,
to join the Polish service, on a certain day. He was
furnished with railway tickets and passports; also, on the
night before his departure, with a letter to friends in
Prague where he was to await my coming, and with a
letter to friends in Warsaw, in case political exigencies
should delay my arrival in Prague. The Prague letter
has not been delivered, nor has Mr. Briggs appeared in
Warsaw. Nor have I received from him any explanatory
communication. That he should have changed his
mind at the last moment is incredible, as his more than
zealous intentions cannot be questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This letter, therefore, has a double object; first to acquaint
you with these facts: and secondly to beg you of
your courtesy to give me any information you may possess
as to the fate of one whom I learned to hold in affectionate
esteem.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Paul Boronowski</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia grew very pale. Her hand shook as she gave the
letter back to Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something must have happened to him,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has always happened to him,” she replied
bitterly. “He says one thing and does another. One
more senseless extravagant lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was obviously going to Poland,” said Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he never started!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olifant persisted: “How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can one ever know about him except that truth
has no meaning for him? If you suggest that he has perished
by the way on a railway journey between here and
Prague—” she laughed scornfully. “Really, my dear
Blaise, you’re too good for this world. If you caught a
man with his hand in your waistcoat pocket, and he told
you he only wanted to see the time by your watch, you’d
believe him! Haven’t I been through this before? All
this elaborate preparation for missions abroad which
never came off? Didn’t he leave you here to go off to
Helsingfors, and John o’ Groats was the nearest to it he
got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then where do you think he is now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere, except in Poland. It was the last place
he had any intention of going to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might have written you a false account of his
movements,” Olifant argued, “but why should he have
deceived this good Polish gentleman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s his way,” she replied wearily. “Oh, don’t you
see? He’s always acting to himself. He can’t help
leading a fictitious life. I can guess the whole thing.
He goes to this Mr. Boronowski—one of his stray Russo-Polish
acquaintances—with the idea in his head of putting
me off his scent. Poland still is romantic and a terribly
long way off. He can’t do a thing simply. He must do
it fantastically. It’s not enough that I should think he
was going to Poland. Mr. Boronowski must think so,
too. He throws his arms about, persuading himself and
everybody else that he is a Paladin going to fight for the
sacred cause of an oppressed nationality. When the
thing’s done, and the letter to me written, the curtain
comes down on the comedy, and Alexis takes off his war
paint and starts off for Pernambuco—or Haverstock
Hill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re unjust, Olivia,” said Olifant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think you’re too good to be true,” she retorted
angrily, and she left him and went down the garden
path into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her room, her mother’s room, with the old rose
curtains and Chippendale and water colours, she rang
the bell. Myra appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know so much already, Myra,” she said in her
defiant way, “that I think you ought to know everything.
I’ve just heard that Mr. Triona never went to Poland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” said Myra impassively. “Do you know
where he is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. And I don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t quite understand,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would take some interest in the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My interest is your interest. If you never want to
see him again, what does it matter where he is? Perhaps
you’re afraid he’ll come back to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the elder woman’s suggestion, the fear gripped her
with dreadful suddenness. There had not yet been time
for thought of such a possibility. If he had lied about
fighting for Polish freedom, what truth was there in his
perfervid declaration of the severance of his life from
hers? She had been right in her analysis of his character.
The curtain down on whatever comedy he might
be now enacting, he would present himself unexpectedly
before her with specious explanations of the past, and another
glittering scenario of illusion. And with his reappearance
would come exposure. She had pledged
her word to Rowington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seized Myra by the wrist. “Do you think he will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are afraid,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Dreadfully afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you need be,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia flung away. “You take his part, just like Major
Olifant. Neither of you seem to understand.” She
turned. “Don’t you see the horror of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen lots of horrors in my time,” replied Myra
placidly. “But I shan’t see this one. He’s gone for
good, dearie. You may be sure of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could think so,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly lunch time. Myra went out and returned
with a can of hot water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not see him so long as I’m about to look after
you,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Olivia laughed at the dragon of her childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some mornings afterwards, Myra came to her mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it’s convenient to you, I should like a few days’
leave. I’ve had a letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing serious, I hope?” asked Olivia, whose
thoughts flew to the madman in the County Asylum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Myra. “Can I go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Myra packed her worn valise and left Medlow by
the first available train. But the Asylum was not her
destination. The next day saw her seeking admittance
to University College Hospital, London.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span><span class='sc'>HEN</span> Triona after many dim day-dreams and
relapses into nothingness, at last recovered
consciousness, he found himself in a narrow
sort of cubicle, staring upwards at a mile away ceiling.
He was tightly bound, body and legs. He had a vague
memory of a super-juggernaut of a thing killing him;
therefore he sagely concluded that he was dead and this
was the next world. It occurred to him that the next
world had been singularly over-rated, being devoid of
any interest for an intelligent being. Later, when the
familiar figure of a nurse popped round the screen, he
recognized, with some relief, the old universe. He was
alive; but where he was, he had no notion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only gradually did he learn what had befallen him;
that he had laid for weeks unconscious; that he had a
broken thigh and crushed ribs; that most of the time he
had hovered between life and death; that even now he
was a very sick man who must lie quiet and do exactly
what nurses and doctors told him. This sufficed for a
time, while his brain still worked dully. But soon there
came a morning when all the memories surged back. He
questioned the nurse:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you think I can start for Poland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps in six months,” she replied soothingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groaned. “I want to go there now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To join the Polish Army.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had nursed through the war, and knew that men
in his plight were of no further use in armies. Gently
she told him so. He stared uncomprehensively on an
empty world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do when I leave here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have a long, long rest, and do nothing at
all and think of nothing at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to smile at the nurse’s pleasant face. “You’ve
done me a bad turn in bringing me back to life,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they thought him capable of grappling with his
personal affairs, they brought him his bulging pocket-book,
and bade him count his money. He laughed. It
was quite safe. He handed back the roll of notes into
the nurse’s keeping. But the other contents of the case
he looked at dismally: the passport, with the foreign
visas; the railway tickets; the letters to Prague and Warsaw.
What were the good of them now? He would
never go to Poland. When he got strong, all the fighting
would be over. And when he did get strong, in a few
months or a year, he would probably be lame, with odds
and ends of organs gone wrong inside him. He tried to
read the letters; but they were written in Polish—unintelligible
now in spite of his strenuous short study of the
language. They bore a signature which he could not
decipher. But it was certainly not Boronowski. His
mind soon tired of the puzzle. What was the good of
keeping the letters? Drearily he tore them in pieces and
gave them to the nurse to dispose of, when she brought
him a meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired with the effort he slept. He awoke to a sense
of something final done, or something important left undone.
As his brain cleared, he realized that subconsciously
he had been thinking of his duty to Boronowski.
Of course, he must be informed at once of the reason for
his defection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then dismay overwhelmed him. He had no address
to Boronowski. The only channels of communication
with him, the Prague and Warsaw letters, he had
destroyed. A happy idea struck him. He toyed with it
for what seemed interminable hours until the nurse came
to his bedside. He called for writing materials, which
were smilingly denied him. He was too weak. But
the nurse would write a short letter from dictation. He
dictated two identical letters, one to the Polish Legation,
one to the Polish Consulate, asking for the address of
Mr. Paul Boronowski, late of 21 Hillditch Street, St.
Pancras. By return of post came polite replies from
Legation and Consulate. Both disclaimed any knowledge
of the identity of Mr. Paul Boronowski. Legation
and Consulate were blandly ignorant of the existence of
their confidential agents. Then he remembered the baffling
signature to the two letters. He laughed somewhat
bitterly. His life seemed to be involved in a tangle
of false names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, what did it matter? But it did matter,
vitally. If ever he had set his soul on a true thing, he had
set it on keeping faith with Boronowski. And Boronowski
like the rest of the world would set him down as an
impostor. In his desperate physical weakness the tears
rolled down his cheeks; and so the nurse found him,
with one of the letters clutched in his thin hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My only friend in the world,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead?” asked the nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you have at least one more,” she said. “In
fact I have written to her to tell her of your recovery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Her?</span>” He looked at the nurse out of ghastly eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Myra Stebbings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God!” said he, and fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereat the nurse, anxious to bring him comforting
tidings was exceedingly troubled. The shock put him
back for two or three days. He grew light-headed, and
raved about a woman called Olivia, and about all sorts
of strange and incomprehensible things. When he regained
his senses it was an awakening to a life of even
more terrifying consternation than before. Myra, he
learned, had called daily at the hospital—to be denied access
to him till he should be in a fit state to receive her.
The nurse told him of her first visit the morning after
the accident and of the newspaper paragraph which she
had chanced to read. But if Myra knew, surely Olivia
knew. And Olivia, knowing him to have been for weeks
at death’s door, had treated him, as though he had already
passed through that door to the other side. Horror
gripped him. He questioned the nurse. This Miss Stebbings,
had she left no message? No, she was a woman of
few words. She had said, in an unemotional way: “I’ll
come in again to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake don’t let her see me,” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after a while he countermanded the request. He
would learn the worst, and meet steadily the supreme
punishment, the tale of Olivia’s implacable hatred.
There were degrees in a woman’s scorn. Much he knew
he had justly incurred; but his sick frame shuddered at
this maximum of contempt and loathing. Ill-conditioned
dog he avowed himself; yet to let him die, for aught she
knew, like a dog, without sign or word of interest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it
transcended thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure there has been no other lady? Not a
letter of enquiry? Nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll make yourself bad again, if you worry like
that,” said the nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to God I could,” said he; “and that would
be the end of it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a large ward of a London hospital, nurses have not
much time to devote to the sick fancies of patients.
More than enough for them were their physical needs.
The crumb of kindly commonplace was all that the nurse
could give to the man’s hungering soul. He passed the
day, staring up at the mile-high ceiling, incurious as to
what vista of misery lay beyond the still remaining
American-cloth covered screen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the shaft of fierce sunshine on the wall to his
right, he gathered that spring had passed into early
summer. The outside world was a-riot in the new life of
wild flowers and trees and birds and human hopes and
loves. Outside that prison of his—a whitewashed wall, a
screen, a window behind his head reaching sky-high—spread
this world with whose pulsations his heart had
ever throbbed in unison. God! How he had loved it!
Every leaf, every crested wave, every patch of sand,
every stretch of heat, every rusty horse grazing on a
common, every child before a cottage door, every vibrating
sound or sight of great cities, every waste in regions
of grand desolation, every man with sinews or with purpose
in his eyes, every woman parading the mystery of
her sex, from the tow-haired, dirt-encrusted goose-girl of
a Russian village to the wonder of ever inscrutable wonders
that was Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all his dreams he inevitably came back to Olivia.
Indeed she was the centripetal force of his longings.
All that earth held of the rustle of leaves and the murmur
of waters, the magic of dawn and the roar of town
multitudes and the laughter of green forests and the
silence of frozen steppes, were incorporated in the woman
of his adoration. Through her spoke the voices of the
infinite universe. And all that was visible of it, the patch
of sunlight on the whitewashed wall, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She lives and I, a reflected glory of her, live too; but
even if you go hence I shall only appear mockingly before
you, on prison walls, until you are dead. And you will
never find me on the blue seas or the joyous roads or the
stone-bounded, clattering haunts of mankind, other than
a meaningless mirage, because the inspired meaning of it
all which is Olivia, has passed from you for evermore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn you,” said he, and turned away his head, for
he could not turn his plaster of Paris encased body, and
shut out the white line from his burning eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Myra came. He had been prepared
for her visit. She sat on the cane-bottomed chair by his
bedside. As soon as the nurse left them together:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you are better, Sir,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you brought me any message from Mrs.
Triona?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him steadily. “You don’t suppose Mrs.
Triona knows you are here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some time before he could appreciate the meaning
of her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks I’m in Poland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She doesn’t know you are here,” said Myra truthfully.
“She doesn’t know where you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or care?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or care,” said Myra, and her tone was flat like that
of a Fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while he was silent, accepting the finality of
Myra’s words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve left her in ignorance of my accident?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Myra. “Haven’t you done the same since
you’ve recovered your wits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her dry logic was unanswerable. Yet a man does not
expect logic from an elderly waiting-woman. He passed
a hand over his eyes and held it there for a long time,
while Myra sat patient and unemotional. He understood
nothing of her motives. For the moment he did not seek
to understand them. One fact alone mattered. Olivia
did not know. She had not, with horrible contempt, left
him to die like a dog. By the thought of such a possibility
he had wronged her. She might, with every reason,
desire never to set eyes on him again—but of active
cruelty he should have known her incapable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he withdrew his hand and turned to Myra.
“My head’s not altogether right yet,” he said half-apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can quite believe it,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you should bother with me, I don’t understand,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I,” she replied in her disconcerting way.
“If you had died I shouldn’t have been sorry. For her
sake. Now you’re not going to die, I’m glad. For
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said he with a note of irony. And then
after a pause:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is your mistress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is quite well, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begging your pardon, sir,” said Myra stiffly, “but I’ve
not come here to be asked questions. I’ve no intention
of your using me as a go-between.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It never entered my head,” he declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might,” said Myra. “So I give you warning.
Whatever go-between-ing I do will be to keep you apart
from Mrs. Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why are you worrying about me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’ve found you in affliction and I’m a Christian
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither of them understood the other. He said suddenly
with a flash of the old fire:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you swear you’ll never tell your mistress where
I am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint light flickered in her pale eyes. “I’ll swear if
you like. But haven’t you taken in what I’ve been telling
you all the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long as we can trust each other—that is all that
matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can trust me all right,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked the ground over again for a while longer.
Then he grew tired with the strain, and the nurse put an
end to the interview. But Myra came the next day and
the day after that, and Triona grew to long for her visit.
He became aware of a crabbed kindness in her attitude
towards him side by side with her jealous love for Olivia.
She was anxious for his welfare within grimly prescribed
limitations. His immediate future concerned her. What
did he purpose to do with his invalid-dom after his discharge
from the hospital? He himself, at this stage, had
no notion. He confided to her the despair of his active
life. The motor-lorry had wrecked his hopes of salvation.
He told her the whole Boronowski story. Myra
nodded; but faithful to the part she had chosen, she said
nothing of Boronowski’s letter to Major Olifant. Only
by keeping the lives of the ill-fated pair in tightly sealed
and non-communicable compartments, could she be true
to an ethical code formulated by many definite sorrows
and many vague, but none the less poignant, spiritual conflicts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s funny,” said he, “that you’re the only human being
I should know in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her intuition skipped the gap of demonstration of so
extraordinary a pronouncement, and followed his flight
into the Unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be luck for you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled wistfully on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hung on her answer which she took some time to
give. In the lines on the pallid face, in the dull blue eyes
of this sphinx-like woman so correct in her negative attire
of black coat and skirt and black hat with just a
redeeming touch of white, and on the thin, compressed
lips, his sick man’s brain seemed to read his destiny.
She hovered over him, impressive, baffling, ever about-to-be
oracular. Combined with her mystery existed the
strange fact that she was his sole link with the world,
not only the great humming universe of thought and
action, but the inner spiritual world in which Olivia
reigned. He regarded her with superstitious dread and
reverence; conscious all the time of the comedy of so
regarding the woman whose duty had been to fold up his
trousers and set out his underclothes on the hot rail of
the bathroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do when you leave?” she asked,
and he guessed a purpose behind her question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must hide until I am strong enough to take up active
life again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will you hide?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t know. He had not thought—so remote did
the date of his discharge appear. It must be some
secluded, man-forgotten spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the worst comes to the worst and you need a place
where you’ll be looked after, I’ll give you an address of
friends of mine,” said Myra. “You’ll, maybe, spend the
rest of your life on crutches, and have all sorts of things
wrong inside you. I shouldn’t like you to feel I was
abandoning you. If you were broken down and needed
help, I suppose you wouldn’t write to me, would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I most certainly shouldn’t,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” said Myra. “In that case I’d better
give you the address.” She scribbled it on the writing pad
by his bedside. “There. Take it or leave it. It’s the
best I can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left him with an abrupt “Good day, sir,” and took
the next train back to Medlow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t had a long holiday, Myra,” Olivia
remarked when she arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say I was going on a holiday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope things were all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As right as they ever can be,” replied Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weary weeks of convalescence dragged themselves
out. Myra did not come again; and of course he had
no other visitor. He made casual acquaintances in the
ward; here and there an ex-soldier with whom he could
exchange reminiscences of warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once a discharged sailor in the next bed—the screen
had long since been removed—recovering from an operation,
spoke to him of mine-sweeping days, and perils of
storm and submarine and he grew to regard him as a
brother. Both regretted the deluging waters of the North
Sea. The sailor in these times of peace drove a dust
cart for the St. Pancras Borough Council. The wages
were good—but what a life for a sea-faring man! He
would have stuck to his old job were it not that a wave
had washed him down on the slithery deck and had
brought his knee-cap up against a stanchion and had
stiffened it out so that his career on board-ship was over.
But those were good times, weren’t they? Oh yes. Of
course they groused. But they only groused when
they had time. Mostly they hadn’t. Dust-collecting
was an open-air life, true enough; but there was a difference
between the smell of brine and the stench of house
refuse. It was in summer that it made him sick. The
odours of the fo’c’sle were not those of a hairdresser’s shop—nothing
smelt so fine, he declared, as a hairdresser’s
shop—they were a bit thick, but a man could go on deck
and fill his lungs with good salt air. And the grub!
What an appetite! He conjured up gargantuan meals
in perilous tempests. Nothing of the sort now. Everything
he ate tasted of sour potato peelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the taste of everything in these post-war days,”
said Triona, “everything in life—sour potato peelings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dustman reckoned he was right. In those old days
of mine-sweeping, a man had no anxieties. He had no
responsibilities. He was happy as the day was long.
Now he was married and already had a couple of kids.
Life was just one wearisome worry, a continuous accumulation
on the debit side of the slate, with few advantages
on the credit side to balance. If it wasn’t the wife it was
the boy; if it wasn’t the boy, it was the baby; and if it
wasn’t them, it was his appendix which had just been
removed. Whoever heard of a sailor-man aboard ship
getting appendicitis? No, all them things, said he, were
blessings of peace. Besides, how was he going to feed
his family when they grew older? And clothes, boots,
schooling? And he himself—limited to beer—and such
beer! He hadn’t tasted a drop of rum——. Was there
anything like it? Sometimes he saw it and smelt it in
his dreams, but he always woke up before he could put
his lips to the pannikin. If only one could get something
to hold on to in dreams. He never had need to dream of
rum in the navy. So much for peace. Give him the good
old war again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when his wife, a thin lipped, scraggy blonde, with
a moth-eaten fur stole round her neck (although it was
sweltering summer), and a pallid baby in her arms came
to visit him, and spoke querulously of domestic affairs,
Triona gave him his unreserved sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it ain’t,” said the ex-mariner, “as if I couldn’t
carry on straight and proper in civil life. I wonder how
many of my mates are getting what I’m getting. She
ought to be proud of me, she ought. Instead of that—you
heard what she said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona had heard. She had upbraided him for his
ungenteel occupation, considering herself, the daughter
(so Triona learned) of a small sweet-stuff monger in
Dover, where they had met during his sea-going days,
socially degraded by her marriage with a municipal collector
of dust. She had married him, by the by, before his
present appointment, while he was drawing out-of-work
pay. Apparently he was possessed of some low-comedy
histrionic talent, and she was convinced that he could
make his fortune as a cinema star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You married?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been through it,” said the misogynist.
“Women! There never was a woman who knew when
she was well off! Oh, Gawd! Give me the old days on
the <span class='it'>Barracouta</span>, where there wasn’t any thought of women.
That was my last ship. I had nine months in her. There
was <span class='it'>Barracouta</span>, <span class='it'>Annie Sandys</span>, <span class='it'>Seahorse</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ran through the names of his squadron, forgetful, in
the sudden flush of reminiscence, of domestic cares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did you say you were in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vestris.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I remember. Torpedoed. But even that
was better than this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona agreed, and the eternal talk of the sea went on,
until the nostalgia for the wide, free spaces of the world
gripped his vitals with the pains of hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do when you come out?” asked
the dustman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the same as you,” replied Triona. “What’s
the good of a man with a game leg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dustman sighed. “You’ve got education,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, aware of accent and manner of expression, the
dustman had taken him for an ex-officer. Only the
discharge-papers of John Briggs, able-seaman, convinced
him of John Briggs lowly estate. Still, in the <span class='it'>Barracouta</span>
they had an elderly stoker who had been at Cambridge
College. Such a man might be his neighbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ran away to sea when I was a boy,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So had the dustman. He waxed more confidential.
His name was Josh Bunnings, and he had sailed in every
conceivable kind of craft from Alaska to Singapore.
But he had found no time for education. How did his
neighbour acquire it? Books? He shook his head. He
had been cured of books on his first voyage, when the
second mate catching him reading a tattered manual on
gardening, when he ought to have been washing up in
the galley, had kicked and cuffed him round the deck.
Triona’s mind went back to his boyhood—to an almost
identical incident. There was much in common between
himself and Josh Bunnings. They had started on even
terms. They had met on even terms in the foul fo’c’sles
on the North Sea. They were on even terms, now, lying
side by side, lamed, their life of free adventure a thing
of the past. Each dreaded the future; Josh Bunnings
condemned to cart refuse beneath the affected nose of
a shrew of a wife for the remainder of his days; he,
Triona, to deal with such refuse as the world would leave
him, but away from the wife who abhorred him and all
his works. On the other hand, between him and Josh
Bunnings lay a great gulf. He had made himself a man
of wide culture. Josh Bunnings had remained abysmally
ignorant. But Josh Bunnings had lived his life an honourable
man. If he told his story to Josh Bunnings he
would be condemned by him, even as he had been condemned
by his sister on the morning of his mother’s
funeral. So, when the dustman, with another sigh,
harked back to his former idea and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only I had education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a damned sight better man than I am, without
it,” Triona replied bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the three weeks’ comradeship came to an end,
on the discharge of Josh Bunnings, he found himself lost
again in a friendless world. The neighbouring familiar
bed was occupied by an ancient man in the throes of
some ghastly malady, and around him was stretched the
horrible, death-suggesting screen. And behind the screen,
a week later, the old man died. It was to relieve the
nervous tension of this week that he began a correspondence
with Josh Bunnings. The writing man’s instinct
awoke—the mania of self-expression. His letters to the
dustman, full of the atmosphere of the ward, vivid with
lightning sketches of house-surgeons, sisters, nurses and
patients, with here and there excursions into contrasting
tempests, storms of battle, and everywhere touched with
the magic of his queer genius, would, if sent to his literary
agents, have gained him a year’s subsistence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Josh Bunnings visited him occasionally, when freed
from municipal, and escaped from domestic, obligations.
The visits, he explained, were in return for the letters;
for being no scholar, he could not reply. Then one day
he appeared and sat on the chair by Triona’s bed, with
the air of a man about to bring glad tidings. He was
rather a heavy, pallid, clean-shaven man, with a curl of
black hair sweeping down to his eyebrows. His small
dark eyes gleamed. At once he disemburdened his honest
soul. He was a Church of England man; always held
with church-going—so did his wife; it was the great bond
of union between them. So he was on friendly terms
with the curate of St. Simon’s. And being on friendly
terms with the curate, he had shewn him the letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, would you believe it, mate?” said he. “Would
you believe it? He wants to put them in print in the
Parish Magazine. In print! Fancy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slapped his thigh. Triona stared at him for a moment
and then laughed out loud for the first time for
many weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you laughing at?” asked the astonished
Bunnings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems so funny,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a great honour,” said Triona recovering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Only he said he couldn’t print ’em without
your permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona gave permission, stipulating, however, that his
name should not be used. His modesty forbade it he
explained. Josh Bunnings went away delighted. In the
course of a few posts came a grateful letter from the curate.
In Mr. Briggs’s writing he saw signs of considerable
literary talent which he hoped Mr. Briggs would
cultivate. If he could be of help in this way, he put his
services at Mr. Briggs’s disposal. Triona again laughed,
with grim amusement, at a funny, ironical world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, suddenly, the underlying tragedy of this comic
interlude smote him breathless. Alexis Triona was dead
and so were his writings, for evermore. But the impulse
to write stirred within him so vehemently that even in
these idle letters to Josh Bunnings he had put all his
vividness of literary expression. The curate’s dim
recognition of the unusual was a sign and a token.
Whatever he wrote would be stamped with his individuality
and if published, even anonymously, would lead
to his identification. The arresting quality of his style
had been a main factor in his success. This flashing
pictorial way of his he could not change. If he strove
self-consciously to write sober prose, he would produce
dull, uninspired stuff that no man could read; if he lost
self-consciousness, automatically he would betray himself.
He would re-appear in the Olivia-dominated world.
Every book or article would dance before her eyes like
an <span class='it'>ignis fatuus</span>, reminding her maddeningly of his existence
in her propinquity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An <span class='it'>ignis fatuus</span>. At this point of his reflection he
remembered his first talk with her, wherein he had counselled
her never to lose faith in her Will-o’-the-Wisp,
but to compel it to be her guiding star. More ironical
laughter from the high gods! And yet, why not? He
wrestled with the temptation. As he lay, convalescent
on his back, his brain clear, the sap of youth working in
his veins, the uncontrolled fancies of the imaginative
writer wove themselves into shreds of fine romance and
tapestries of exquisite scenes. Just a little concentration,
impossible in the open hospital ward, and all these would
blend together into a thing of immortal beauty. He
would find a publisher. Nothing easier. No name
would appear. Or else, perhaps, as a handle for convenience
sake, he would sign the book “Incognito.” It
would stir the hearts of men, and they would say: “There
is but one man living who could do this and that is Alexis
Triona.” And Olivia, reading it, and beholding him in
it, would find her heart stirred with the rest, yet far far
more deeply than the rest, and would seek him out, obeying
his far-off counsel, and believe that, in his essential
self and in his infinite love, he was verily her guiding-star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the hour of exaltation had passed and given
way to the dreary commonplace, when the nurse came
to wash him like a child, or to chatter pleasantly of the
outside world, the revue which she had seen on her free
afternoon, or the sentimental novel which had beguiled
her scanty leisure, he knew that he had been living in a
land of dreams. His real achievement Olivia knew, and
by it she was unmoved. Myra had held out to him no
chance of hope; only certainty of despair. By no further
achievement could Olivia be persuaded. She realized
her Will-o’-the-Wisp as what it really was, a
miasmatic gas leading her into quagmires. She would
bitterly resent his reappearance. It would be another
trick, another way of flaunting before her under false
pretences. As well write to her now that he was a
mangled wreck in University College Hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of time he was able to leave his bed and
be wheeled about the ward and afterwards to hobble
about on a crutch. But the injured leg was just a bit
shorter than the other, so that he was condemned to a
perpetual limp; and though the ribs were mended, yet
their breakage had occasioned internal lesions which
would have to be watched for the rest of his life. No
more adventures in wide spaces. No more tramps to
John o’ Groats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m a born wanderer,” he cried to the surgeon
who made the final pronouncement. “What shall I do
when the wander fever is on me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fill yourself up with bromide and stick leeches on
your head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed into the smiling kindly face, and was silent
for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can drive a car, I suppose?” he said after a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safer to drive a horse. You haven’t to crank it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I’m going out, a hopeless crock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t live,
with reasonable care, to ninety. You’re fit for light
work. Why not office work? An educated chap like
you——By the way, you were off to Poland, if I
remember rightly, when you met with your accident.
What’s your trade or profession?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before the war, I was a cosmopolitan chauffeur,” said
Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And since?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The damnedest fool God ever made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The surgeon asked him no more questions.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>F</span><span class='sc'>ANSTEAD</span> is a little country town built on the
plan of a sparsely equipped herring bone.
There is the central High Street, a jumble of old
half-timbered houses and staring modern red-brick buildings,
and sprouted from it a series of lateral roads, lanes
and alleys, dwindling in importance to the High Street
tip, and each petering out into the sweet country vagueness
of hedges and fields. All save two. One of these
ends abruptly at an inconveniently distant railway station.
The other, villa bordered, meanders pleasantly
for a mile or so to the tiny village of Pendish where it
meets at right angles the great high road, and stops modestly,
confronted all of a sudden with rolling open
country, swelling downs patched with meadow and corn-field
and crowned with great clumps of woodland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pendish was too small even to have a church. There
was a tiny chapel for the convenience of Baptists. But
Anglicans tramped into Fanstead or to the larger village
of Banton-on-the-Hill, another mile along the great high
road. It had a tumbled-down inn, the “Whip and
Collar,” and a straggling row of thatched cottages, and
a tiny red-brick villa labelled as the home of the County
Police. But it also had a post-office, which was also a
shop; and this was a small, square two-storied Georgian
house imposing among its thatched neighbours and maintaining
itself with a curious air of dignity, in spite of
the front door open to the public during business hours,
and the miscellaneous assortment of sweets, tobacco,
tapes and picture postcards exposed in what was once the
dining-room window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the freehold of Mrs. Pettiland, a widow of
fifty; she had inherited it from her father, a Norfolk
thatcher who had brought his mystery to the west and
practising it with skill and saving a little fortune brought
to him by his wife, had amassed enough to buy the square
stone house where he had ended his days. They said
in the village that he had never recovered from the shock
occasioned by the fate of his son, his apprentice and later
his partner, who had gone raving mad a week or two after
his marriage and had to be confined in the County
Asylum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, the old man had slept with his fathers for many
years; his wife had joined him; the son still lingered on in
the madhouse; and Mrs. Pettiland, very much alone in
the world, save for her husband’s relatives in Fanstead,
sold stamps and sweets to the village, and as a very great
favour let the best bedroom to an occasional painter with
unimpeachable introductions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was dark-haired, fresh-coloured, and buxom; she
dressed with neatness, wearing old-fashioned stays that
gave her a waist and a high bust; and she was the most
considerable personage in Pendish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had received a letter from her sister-in-law,
Myra Stebbings, asking her as a favour to put up a foolish
young man named Briggs who had got himself run
over by a motor-lorry, if ever he should act on her suggestion
and come to Pendish, she considered it less as an
introduction than as a command. Whether she loved
Myra or not, she did not know. But she had an immense
respect for the dry, grey-faced woman who had come
every year to stay with her, so that she could visit the
brother whom she had loved, in the house of awfulness,
five or six miles away. She stood somewhat in awe of
Myra. Her own good man had died comfortably in his
bed and had gone for ever, after a couple of years of
placid content. It was sad; but it was the common lot.
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. But at the
idea of a woman’s husband being shut off from the world
in the living tomb of the County Asylum, she shuddered.
Myra always conveyed to her the vague impression, so
impossible to be formulated by an uneducated woman
ignorant of traditional reference, of a human soul defying
the tragedy of existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when this Mr. Briggs wrote from the hospital in
London, she sent him a cordial answer. Any friend of
Myra Stebbings was more than welcome. She would not
charge him more than out-of-pocket expenses. For she
did not know who this foolish young man might be.
Myra sphinx-like, as usual, had given no clue. But for
Myra to ask a favour was an unprecedented occurrence.
She must have far more than ordinary interest in the
welfare of the young fellow. Mrs. Pettiland’s curiosity
was aroused and she awaited the arrival of her new lodger
with impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The station car from the Fanstead garage brought
him, on a late summer afternoon, with his brown canvas
kit-bag and suit-case and khaki overcoat. She stood in
the pedimented doorway, over which was fixed the
wooden post-office board, and watched him descend. He
faced her for a moment, and raised his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Pettiland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at his clear cut face, so boyish in spite of
whiteness and haggardness, at his careless brown hair
sweeping over his temples, at the lips parted in a smile,
at the lithe young figure. She caught the significance of
his uplifted hat and the pleasant tone of his voice. In
her limited category of values he would be only one thing—a
gentleman. The manners of an instant charmed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Briggs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I shan’t be a dreadful nuisance to you, but I
need rest and quiet and Miss Stebbings told me to come.
And,” he smiled, “What she says generally goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that you know her, sir,” said Mrs. Pettiland
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The luggage taken in, the cab dismissed she led him
up to his room—a large bed-sitting room, looking over
a wild garden and a wide expanse of rolling downs, with
the faint white ribbon of high road circling in and out
and round about them. His meals, she informed him,
he could take in the parlour downstairs, without extra
charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I insist on paying my way,” he said. “Unless
my staying here is profitable to you, I can’t remain. For
the present at least, I can well afford it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So a modest arrangement was made and Triona settled
down in his new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some days he enjoyed the peace of Pendish. He
had brought with him books, ordered from the hospital;
books which would take him long to read; some of the
interminable modern French novels; a complete Fielding
and Smollett; <span class='it'>Paradise Lost</span> and <span class='it'>The Faerie Queene</span>,
neither of which he had as yet had time to go through.
He spent hours in the sunny garden riotous with ingenous
roses and delphinium and Canterbury bells and burning
red-hot pokers as they call them in the West. Often he
limped along the green lanes that wound between the
fields up and down the downs. Becoming aware that
he knew nothing of bird-life, he procured through the
Fanstead bookshop popular works on British Birds, and
sitting under a tree in a corner of a meadow would strive
to identify them by their song and plumage and queer
individual habits. He talked to the villagers. He talked
to Mrs. Pettiland, who told him the tragic story of Myra
and the man in the County Asylum. Of Myra’s doings
all the year round, he found she knew little. She was
with her lady whom she had served most of her life and
had gone back with her to Medlow. Of the lady herself
Myra never spoke. Mrs. Pettiland did not know
whether the lady was married or not. That was Myra
Stebbings’s way. She gave no information and no one
dared ask her questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She never even told me, in her letter, who you were,
sir,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am just under her protection,” he smiled. “She
took me up when I had no one to defend me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a curious woman,” sighed Mrs. Pettiland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With strange tastes in protégés.” He laughed. “To
tell you the truth, Mrs. Pettiland, I don’t quite know
myself what I am. But doubtless sooner or later I’ll
do something to astonish you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yearning to do this fretted his secret heart. To
move about the summer fields when the weather was fine,
to lounge in an easy-chair over books in seasons of rain,
was all very well for the period of convalescence after
the confinement in the hospital ward. But after a while,
when his muscles regained strength and the new blood
coursing through his veins brought colour to his cheeks,
he began to feel the old imperious need of movement and
of action. Sometimes he went back, as in his talks with
the dustman, to the idyllic tempests in the North Sea;
sometimes to the fierce freedom of the speed across the
illimitable steppes of Russia; sometimes to his perilous
escape to Petrograd; sometimes to his tramps along the
safe roads of England; to his wanderings through the
dangerous by-ways of the East End. Bitterly he cursed
the motor-lorry that had knocked him out of his Polish
adventure. Except on Olivia he had never so set his
heart on a thing before. Well, he shrugged angry shoulders.
It was no use thinking of that. Poland had gone,
like Olivia, out of his life. And when he came to think
of it, so had everything that had made up all that he had
known or conceived of life.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He closed <span class='it'>Tom Jones</span>, and stared out of the window on
the rain-drenched hills; Tom Jones, with his physical
lustiness, his strong animal bravura, was more than he
could bear. Tom Jones, no matter in what circumstance
he was placed, had all the world before him. His gay
confidence offended the lost man. For he was lost. Not
a lost soul, he told himself; that was taking an absurd
Byronical view of the matter. To pose as a modern
Manfred would be contemptible. He went down to bed-rock
of commonplace. He was a lost man—a fact which
was quite serious enough for any human being to contemplate
with dismay. Lost, tied by a lame leg in a
deadly little backwater of the world, where he must remain
till he died. He could write, pour out all the
fever of his soul into words. But what was the good,
if no word of his could be transmitted from this backwater
into the haunts of men? Work without hope—a
verse of Coleridge came vaguely to him—was like draining
nectar through a sieve. It could only end in heart-break.
He stared through the dripping window-pane at
the free hills, dim and hopeless in the mist of deluge.
Nothingness confronted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered whether Myra, with diabolical insight
and deliberate malice, had not lured him hither, so that
she could hold him in relentless grip. At any rate she
had cast him into this prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay awake all that night. The next morning the
sky had cleared and the sun shone down on the gratefully
steaming land of green. He breakfasted in the tiny
parlour opposite the shop-post-office on the ground floor.
The ornaments in it were those of long ago. Prints of
the landing of the Guards after the Crimea, of Queen
Victoria and the Prince Consort. Curiously carved and
polished coconut shells, and a great egg on which a
staring mermaid was nudely painted stood on the mantelpiece.
On the chiffonier were calabashes, with gaudy
figures of indigenous Indians, such as came from the West
Indies seventy years ago, and a model of a full-rigged
ship under a glass case, and a moulting stuffed toucan,
with its great beak and yellow and red plumage. The
late Mr. Pettiland’s father, he had learned, had followed
the sea. So, beside the objects on the crowded mantelpiece
and in front of palm-leaf fans were sprigs of white
coral and strings of strange beads, and a dumpy, shapeless,
wooden Polynesian god. And at the end lay a great
conch shell with its wide, pink, curving lips, mysterious
and alluring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could scarcely eat. The night had shaken him.
He gulped down some food and coffee, lit a pipe and
wandered restlessly about the room, looking at these
tokens of the lands far away which he had never seen.
The coral fascinated him. In the hospital he had read
<span class='it'>Typee</span> and <span class='it'>Oomoo</span> of Herman Melville in Dent’s cheap
collection of classics. The sight of the coral quickened
dormant longings. He took the great conch-shell in his
hand wondering at its beauty of curve and colour. And
as he did so his mind went back to early childhood—to
an old aunt whom he occasionally was taken to visit in
torturing Sunday clothes sacrosanct from the defilement
of jam under dreadful penalties, and who possessed such
a shell. He remembered that the shell was the glory that
compensated the frigid horror of that house. He would
hold it to his ear and listen to the boom of far-off surfs
and then go home and mingle the message with the pointing
finger of Salvation Yeo. And now, grown man,
inured to adventure, he put the shell to his ear, and the
message was the same, vibrating the call of oceans thundering
on distant beaches through the fibres of his being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out into the garden and stood in the sun and
looked almost unseeingly at the rolling downs. Suddenly
he became aware of the ribbon of road that lost
itself not far away, behind a bluff. It was the Great
High Road that led eventually to a great western port,
where great ships sailed to the South Seas. The Power
seemed to impel him, as it had impelled him as a boy
to run away from home. By following that road, he
would reach the port. At the port he could ship before
the mast. On board his limp would not matter. For
the rest, he was strong, as strong as a lion, in spite of all
pronouncements by the doctors. It was the one adventure
life left open to him. Nay more, the one chance of
maintaining his reason. He stood with hands clenched
staring at the road, the sweat beading on his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To pack up belongings and arrive with genteel suit-case
and kit-bag at the dock-side and expect to be taken
on as an ordinary hand would be the act of an embecile.
He passed his hand mildly through his hair in his instinctive
gesture. Why not go as he was, a cap on his head,
and his money, all he had in the world, in a belt (bought
for Poland) round his waist? It was escape from
prison. Escape from Myra. The final disappearance
from the orbit of Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was the maddest thing he had done in his
life. But what did it matter? If he crocked up, he
crocked up. At least he could try. He went indoors
and in the parlour found an old railway timetable.
There were only two trains a day from Fanstead to the
main-line junction, and the morning train had already
gone. Why should he not tramp to the Junction, as in
the old days, getting a lift here and there on a cart, and
know again the freedom of the vagabond road?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went up to his room, put on his belt of money and
good thick boots, and made up a bundle of necessaries.
On his dressing-table he left a letter addressed to Mrs.
Pettiland, enclosing a month’s rent. He looked round
the room for the last time, as he had looked round so
many in his life, and laughed. No books on this journey.
As he had not left the Tyneside with books years ago, so
would he start now afresh, with the same equipment. He
went downstairs with a light heart, and called out to
Mrs. Pettiland busy in her post-office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going off on a jaunt—so don’t expect me till you
see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the answer came: “Don’t overdo yourself with
your lame leg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at the idea. His leg could bear his whole
weight to-day without a twinge. Retracing his steps
down the passage, he entered the garden and left the
place by the wicket-gate and struck up the winding lanes
and across fields to the high road, his stick and bundle
over his shoulder. By doing so, instead of taking the
road at the end of the village, he could cut off a mile.
It was a morning of freshness and inspiration. A cool
breeze sent the clouds scurrying across the sky and
rustled the leaves of the elms and rippled the surface
of the half-grown corn. His spirits rose as he walked,
somewhat of a jog-trot walk, it is true, but that would
last for the rest of his life; so long as the pain had gone
for ever, all was well. He reached the high road and
settled down to his tramp, gladdened by the sight of cart
and car and cottage gardens flaming with roses and
hollyhocks or restful with screens of sweet-peas. In the
soft-mannered West-country fashion, folks gave him
“good day” as he passed. The road undulated pleasantly,
now and then sweeping round the full bosom of
a hill, with a steeply sloping drop of thirty feet to the
valley. Such spots were grimly sign-posted for motorists;
for at one of them, so Mrs. Pettiland had told him,
a motor-lorry during the war had slipped over at night
and all the occupants had been killed. He regarded it
with a chauffeur’s eye and smiled contemptuously at the
inefficiency of the driver. He could race along it at sixty
miles an hour. But still, if you did go over—there was
an end of you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By noon he was hungry and ate cold meat and bread
at a wayside inn, and smoked contentedly afterwards on
the bench outside and talked of crops and licensing laws
with the landlord. When he started again he felt stiff
from the unaccustomed exercise. Walking would relax
his muscles. Yet he began to tire. A while later he
came upon a furniture removing van which had broken
down. Two men drew their heads from below the bonnet
and looked at each other ruefully, and their speech
was profane. He asked what was wrong. They didn’t
know. He threw off his coat, glad to get to an engine
again, and in a quarter of an hour had set it going
merrily. For two or three miles he sat on the tailboard
between the two canvas-aproned packers, enjoying the
respite. When they turned off eventually from the main
road, and he had to descend, he felt strangely disinclined
to walk. The Junction was still a long way off. It
would have been better, after all, to wait for the evening
train from Fanstead. He was always starting on crazy
ventures without counting the cost. But he limped on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road went through a desolate land of abandoned
quarry and ragged pine woods. The ascent was steep.
Suddenly, as though someone had pierced his leg with hot
iron, flamed the unmistakable pain. He stood aghast at
the pronouncement of doom. At that moment, while he
hung there in agony, a rough figure of a man in old khaki
slacks rose from a near hollow in the quarry and,
approaching him, asked what time it was. Triona took
out his watch, a gold one, the gift of Olivia. It was four
o’clock. The man thanked him gruffly and returned to
his stony Bethel. Triona hobbled on a few more steps.
But the torture was too great. He must rest. The
pine-wood’s cool quiet invited him. He dragged himself
thither wearily, and sat down, his back against the trunk
of a tree. He tried to think. Of course the simplest
method of extrication was to hail any passing car and
beg for a lift, either to the Junction or back to Pendish.
Walking was out of the question. But which of those
ways should he take? The weight of physical tiredness
overwhelmed him and dulled the deciding brain. He had
set out at nine in the morning and it was now four o’clock
in the afternoon. He had not realized how slow his
progress had been. Yes, he was exhausted and sleepy.
Nothing mattered. He rolled on his side, stuck his arm
under his head and fell into a dead sleep. Thirty yards
away, at varying intervals, motor vehicles flashed by.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He was dreaming of a rabbit running across his throat,
when suddenly he awoke to find the rabbit a man’s arm.
He gripped it, instinctively. It was nearly dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil are you doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man replied: “Why we thought you was dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the significance of the plural, his grasp relaxed and
he sat up, staring at two men who had come upon him in
his solitude. They were dirty, unshaven, not nice to look
upon. On one of them he noticed a pair of old khaki
slacks. As soon as he moved they knelt one on each side
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I’d been dead, you’d have run through my
pockets wouldn’t you?” Suddenly he clapped his hands
in front of him. “You swine, you’ve got my watch and
chain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust them aside and scrambled anyhow to his feet,
and struck instinctively with his left full in the face of
the nearest man who had sprung up also. But all his
weight was then on his left foot and the flame of agony
shot up through his thigh and his leg crumpled up before
the blow reached the man. Then the one in the khaki
slacks came in with an upper cut on the point of his jaw
and he fell senseless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he recovered consciousness a few minutes afterwards,
he found himself alone, dazed, rather sick, in an
uncomprehended world of gathering darkness. Black
clouds had swept over the brow of the quarry hill. A
pattering noise some way off struck his ear. He realized
it was rain on the road. He drew himself up to a sitting
posture and in a moment or two recovered wits and memory.
There had been a fight. There was one man in
khaki slacks—why, that was the man who had asked him
the time at four o’clock in the afternoon. He had lain
in wait for him and robbed him of his watch and chain.
What a fool he had been to parade it in this manner.
Well, it was gone. It would teach him a lesson in prudence.
But the other man? How did he come in? Why
did they wait three or four hours before attacking him?
Perhaps the man of the khaki slacks had struggled
against temptation until a more desperate acquaintance
came along. He remembered the landlord of the inn
where he had lunched telling him of an ugly quarrying
village he would pass through, a nest of out-of-works—owing
to quarries, unprofitable at the high rate of wages,
being closed down—living discontented Bolshevik lives on
high out-of-work pay. He cursed his leg. If it had not
failed him, he would have got home on the first man, as
easily as shaking hands—the flabby, unguarded face
shimmered in front of him; and then he could have turned
his attention to the man in khaki slacks, a true loafer
type, spiritless when alone—the kind of man, who, if he
had worn those slacks in the army, would have been in
guard-room every week, and would have cowered as a
perpetual cleaner of latrines under the eyes of vitriol-tongued
sergeants. Far from a fighting man. His imagination
worked, almost pleasurably, in the reconstitution
of the robbery. But for his abominable leg he would
have downed both the degenerate scoundrels, and have
recovered his precious belongings. He damned them and
his leg impartially. The watch and chain were all that
he had kept materially of Olivia. In the morning he had
hesitated as to the advisability of carrying them with him,
gold watches and chains not being customarily accoutrements
of a common sailor in wind-jammer or tramp
steamer fo’c’sle. But sentiment had prevailed. He
could hide them somewhere, when he reached the port,
and at convenient slop-shops he could have reorganized
attire and equipment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain pattering on the open road came dribbling
through the branches of the pines. He cursed the rain.
He must go on somewhere. Absurd to stay in the wood
and get wet through. He struggled to his feet and then
for the first time became aware of a looseness around his
middle. He looked down. His trousers were unbuttoned,
his shirt sagged out immodestly as if the front had
been hurriedly tucked in. His hands sought his waist.
The belt with all the money he had in the world had gone.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>T</span> was close on midnight when a car grated and
stopped in front of the little Georgian house in Pendish,
and the truant stumbled through the door, left
open, into the presence of Mrs. Pettiland who was
anxiously awaiting him. He was wet through, dishevelled,
exhausted. He was shivering with cold and his
face was like the mask of a ghost. She met him in the
passage and dragged him into the little sea-haunted parlour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what have you been doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been worried all day, unable to account for the
money, a month’s rent and board in advance, in the envelope
addressed to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I tell you not to overdo yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He greeted her upbraidings with a laugh of bravado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I set out to-day on my last adventure. This is the
end of it. I’m here for the rest of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be in the churchyard for the rest of eternity,
if you don’t go to bed at once,” she declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She packed him to his room; fussed motherwise about
him; dosed him with ammoniated quinine; stuck hot-water
bottles in his bed; stood over him with hot Bovril
with an egg in it. She prescribed whisky, also hot; but
since the fatal night at Rowington’s dinner party, he
had abjured alcohol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now perhaps you’ll tell me what has happened,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My game leg gave out when I got to some quarries.
I believe the beastly place is called Woorow——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woorow! Why that’s the other side of the county!”
She looked at him aghast. “Do you mean to say that
you walked to Woorow in your state? Really men
oughtn’t to be allowed to run about loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve run about loose since I was fourteen,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a pretty mess you seem to have made of it. And
then what did you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took away the cup of Bovril and poached egg which
he had devoured ravenously, to her womanly satisfaction,
and handed him another. He continued his story,
recounting it, between spoonfulls, in his imaginative way.
When he found he could go no further he curled up to
sleep in a wood. When things went wrong, he assured
her, there was nothing like going to sleep in a wood. All
the pixies and elves and rabbits and stoats and weasels
came and sat round you in a magic circle, shielding you
from harm. What would have happened to the Babes
in the Wood, he cried, if it hadn’t been for the robins?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what your temperature is,” said Mrs. Pettiland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Normal,” said he. “This is the first hour I’ve been
normal for months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take it before I leave you,” she said. “Well, you
went to sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes. He slept like an enchanted dog. He woke up
four hours afterwards to find it pouring with rain. What
could he do? He had to get back. Walking, with his
rotten old leg, was out of the question. In the daytime
a decent looking pedestrian may have the chance of
stopping a motoring Good Samaritan and, with a tale of
sudden lameness, get a lift by the side of the chauffeur.
But at night it was impossible. To stand with arresting
arms outspread in front of the hell-lamps of an advancing
car would be an act of suicidal desperation. No; he
had returned by all sorts of stages. He had almost forgotten
them. A manure cart had brought him some way.
Then he had gone dot and carry one for a mile. Then
something else. He could only hail slow moving traffic
in the wet and darkness. Then he spent an endless time
in the cab of a steam traction engine which he had abandoned
on seeing a two-seater car with flaring head-lamps,
stationed at a cottage gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old campaigner’s instinct, Mrs. Pettiland. What
should it be but a doctor’s car, outside a poor little cottage?
And as the head-lamps were pointing to where
I had come from, I concluded he had drawn up and would
turn round and go where I wanted to get to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And was it a doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. Of course it was. He had taken shelter
from the rain under the hood of the car for an hour.
Then, when the cottage door opened, he had scrambled
out and waited for the owner. There had been a few
words of explanation. By luck, it was Doctor Stansfield
of Fanstead——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Stansfield—why——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why of course. He knows you inside and out. A
charming fellow. He dropped me here, or rather I
dropped him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he never came in to look after you—a man in
your condition? I’ll give him a piece of my mind when
I see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He soothed the indignant lady. The good doctor was
unaware that anything particular was wrong with him.
Poor man, he had been on the go since five o’clock the
previous morning—human beings are born inconsiderate
of the feelings of others—and he was dog-tired. Too
dog-tired even to argue. He would have given a lift to
Judas Iscariot, or the Leper of Aosta, so long as he wasn’t
worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He nearly pitched us over, at a curve called Hell’s
Corner—you know. The near front wheel was just an
inch off the edge. And then he stopped dead and flung
his hands over his eyes and said: ‘Oh, my God!’ He had
lost his nerve. Then when I told his I had driven everything
from a General’s Rolls Royce to an armoured car
all over Russia in the war, he let me take the wheel. And
that’s the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chatted boyishly, in high spirits, and smoked a
cigarette. Mrs. Pettiland went for a clinical thermometer.
To her secret disappointment, his temperature
was only just above normal. She would have loved to
keep him in bed a few days and have the proper ordering
of him. A woman loves to have an amazing fool
of a man at her mercy, especially if she is gifted with a
glimmer of humour. When she left him, he laughed out
loud. Well, he had had his adventure with a vengeance.
A real old Will-o’-the-Wisp chase, which had landed him,
as ever, into disaster. Yet it had been worth it, every bit,
until his leg gave out on the quarry hill. Even his slumber
he did not regret. His miserable journey back, recalling
old days, had its points. It was good to get the
better of circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to his money which was to have started him in life
among coral reefs and conch-shells, that had gone irretrievably.
Of course, he could have gone to the nearest
police-station. But if the miscreants were arrested, he
would have to prosecute. Highway robbery was a serious
affair; the stolen belt packed with bank notes, a
romantic one. The trial would provide a good newspaper
story. There would be most undesirable publicity;
and publicity is the last thing a man dead to the world
would desire. He shrugged philosophic shoulders. Let
the money go. The humour of the situation tickled his
vagabond fancy. He was penniless. That was the comical
end of his pursuit of the <span class='it'>ignis fatuus</span>. The freak
finality and inevitability of it stimulated his sense of the
romantic. If he had been possessed of real courage, he
would have made over all his money, months ago, to
Olivia and disappeared, as he was now, into the unknown.
His experience of life ought to have taught him the inexorable
fatality of compromise. What would he do? He
did not know. Drowsy after the day’s fatigue, and very
warm and comfortable, he did not care. He curled himself
up in the bed and went to sleep.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon, a week afterwards, he limped into Mrs.
Pettiland’s post-office with a gay air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Pettiland,” said he, “at last I have found my
true vocation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to hear it, sir,” she replied undisturbed in
her official duties which consisted in taking the coppers
from a small child in payment for two stamps. “You’ve
been rather restless these last few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona watched the child depart, clasping the stamps
in a clammy hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one hasn’t a penny in the world and starvation
stares you in the face, one may be excused for busy
search for a means of livelihood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got plenty of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You paid me a month’s board and lodging in advance,
the other day—though why you did it, I can’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to run away,” he said cheerfully. “To
compensate you in that miserable manner for inconvenience
was the least I could do. But the gods rightly
stepped in and hauled me back.” He swung himself on
the counter and smiled at her. “I’m a fraud, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plump and decorous lady could not realize his
earnestness. Behind his words lay some jest which she
could not fathom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t believe me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighed. If he had told her a fairy tale she, like all
the rest of the world in his past life, would have believed
him. Now that he told the truth, he met with blank incredulity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to earn my living. I’m taking on a job as
chauffeur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him. “A chauffeur—you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mind ran over his intellectual face, his clothes, his
manners, his talk—free and sometimes disconcertingly
allusive, like that of the rare and impeccably introduced
artists whom she had lodged—his books .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—you’re a gentleman,” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no. Not really. I’ve been all kinds of things in
my time. Among them I’ve passed as a gentleman. But
by trade I’m a chauffeur. I practically started life as a
chauffeur—in Russia. For years I drove a Russian
Prince all over Europe. Now there aren’t any more
Russian Princes I’m going to drive the good people of
Fanstead to railway stations and dinner parties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never,” said Mrs. Pettiland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a young man—an ex-officer—Radnor by
name, in Fanstead—who has just set up a motor garage.”
“He’ll fail,” said Mrs. Pettiland. “They all do. Old
Hetherington of ‘The Bull’ has all the custom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With one rickety death-trap for hire and a fool of a
mechanic who has wrecked every car sent in for repairs
for a radius of thirty miles. I offered Hetherington to
teach him his business. You might as well sing ‘Il
Trovatore’ to a mule. So I went to Radnor. He had just
sacked a man, and with my invariable luck, I stepped in
at the right moment. No, Mrs. Pettiland—” he swung
his sound leg and looked at her, enjoying her mystification
“—the reign of Hetherington is over. Radnor’s
Garage is going to be the wonder of the countryside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He believed it implicitly. Radnor, a mild and worried
young man, with quite a sound knowledge of his business,
might struggle along and earn a hand-to-mouth
living. But he lacked driving-power. To Triona, during
his two or three interviews with him, that was obvious.
He had sufficient capital for a start, a good garage
equipment, a fairly modern 25 h.p. utility car and was
trying to make up his mind to buy another. Triona
divined his irresolution. He would be at the mercy of
unscrupulous mechanics and chauffeurs. His spirit
seemed to have been broken by two years imprisonment
in Germany. He had lost the secret of command. And,
by nature, a modest, retiring gentleman. Triona pitied
him. He had wandered through the West of England
seeking a pitch where the competition was not too fierce,
and finding unprogressive Fanstead, had invested all his
capital in the business. He had been there a couple of
months during which very little work had come in. He
could stick it out for six months more. After that the
deluge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me four pounds a week as head mechanic and
chauffeur,” said Triona, “and the deluge will be golden
rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was after the exhibition of John Briggs’ papers—Armoured
Car Column and Minesweeper—and the tale
of his Russian chauffeurdom. He had also worked
magic, having a diagnostician’s second sight into the inside
of a car’s mechanism, with a mysteriously broken
down 40 h.p. foreign car, the only one in the garage for
repairs, which, apparently flawless, owner and chauffeur
and Radnor himself regarded with hebetude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you on all right,” said Radnor. “But,
surely a man like you ought to be running a show of his
own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t a cent in the world,” replied Triona. “So
I can’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this he told Mrs. Pettiland, swinging his sound leg,
as he sat on the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only fly in the ointment,” said he, “is that I shall
have to move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From here? Whatever for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chauffeurs don’t have luxurious bed-sitting-rooms with
specially designed scenery for views. They can’t afford
it. Besides, they’re not desirable lodgers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed indignantly. If he thought she would prefer
his room to his company, because he drove a car, he
was very much mistaken. The implication hurt. Even
suppose he was fit to look after a car, he was not yet
fit to look after himself. Witness his folly of a week
ago. He would pay her whatever he could afford and she
would be more than contented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What wonderful people there are in the world,” he
sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he withstood her generous blandishments. No,
there was an eternal fitness of things. Besides, he must
live at the garage, ready to attend telephone calls by day
or by night. He couldn’t be hobbling backwards and
forwards between Fanstead and Pendish. Against this
practical side of the question there could be no argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what shall I do with the money you’ve paid in
advance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it for a while,” said he. “Perhaps Randor will
give me the sack and I’ll come creeping back to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did Triona, with bag and baggage take up his
quarters in an attic loft in the garage yard at Fanstead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not since his flight from Olivia had he felt so free of
care. Fate had condemned him to the backwater and in
the backwater he would pass his contented life, a life of
truth and honesty. And he had before him an essential
to his soul’s health—an ideal. He would inspire the
spiritless with spirit, the ineffectual with efficiency, the
sick heart with health. The man Radnor had deserved
well of his country through gallant service, wounds and
imprisonment. His country had given him the military
Cross and a lieutenant’s gratuity, and told him not to
worry it any more. If Mrs. Pettiland’s prophecy came
true and he failed, he would be cast upon a country that
wouldn’t be worried. Triona swore that he should pull
through. He would save a fellow-man from shipwreck,
without his knowledge. It was something to live for.
He became once more the perfect chauffeur, the enthusiastic
motor-man, dreaming of a great garage—a sort of
Palace of Automobiles for the West of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he dreamed, so did it begin to come to pass.
The efficiency of the Quantock Garage became known
for miles around. Owners of valuable cars forsook the
professional wreckers in the great junction town and
sent them to Fanstead. Radnor soon bought his second
car; by the end of the autumn a third car; and increased
his staff. Triona was foreman mechanician. Had he
not so desired, he need not have driven. Nor need he
have driven in the brass-buttoned livery on which he
insisted that Radnor’s chauffeurs should be attired.
Smartness, he argued rightly, caught the eye and imagination.
But he loved the wheel. Driving cooled the
vagabond fire in his veins. There was an old touring-car
of high horse-power, excellent when nursed with loving
hand and understanding heart, but a box of dismal
caprice to the inexpert, which he would allow no one to
drive but himself. Radnor held the thing in horror and
wanted to sell it as a bad bargain. He had had it out
once and it had broken down ten miles from home and
had suffered the ignominy of a tow back. Triona
wrought at it for three weeks, conjuring up spare parts
from nowhere, and fitting to it new devices, and turned
out a going concern in which he took inordinate pride.
He whirled touring parties prodigious distances in this
once rickety creature of his adoption. He could get
thirty-five or forty out of her easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. It’s your funeral, not mine,” said Radnor
during one of their discussions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a healthy life. His lameness did not matter.
Whatever internal lesions he suffered from gave no symptoms
of existence. His face lost its lines of suffering, his
eyes their shifty haggardness. He put on flesh, as far
as is possible for a naturally spare-built man. Randor,
an honourable soul, when the business in the new year
shewed proof of immense development, offered him a
substantial increase in salary. But Triona refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I want with money, my dear fellow? If
I had more I’d only spend it for books. And I’ve more of
them now than I know where to put them. No; keep all
you can for capital in the business. Or stick it into an
advertisement scheme I’ve been working out—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re an odd devil, Briggs,” said Radnor. He was
a small dark man with great mournful eyes and a little
clipped moustache over a timorous mouth, and his lips
were always twitching. “A queer devil. What I should
have done without you, I don’t know. If I could do what
I want, I should offer you a partnership.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a damned fool,” said Triona. “A partner
puts in money and I haven’t a bean. Besides if I were
a partner, the whole show would go to hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should immediately want to go and do something
else,” replied Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give it up,” said Radnor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Best thing you can do,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How could the very grateful young proprietor divine
the spiritual crankiness of his foreman? He went
through the English equivalent of shoulder shrugging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Briggs, from the business point of view, was a treasure
fallen from Heaven. And Briggs was a mystery. He
didn’t begin to pretend to understand Briggs. Briggs obviously
didn’t want to be understood. Radnor was a
gentleman. He could press the matter no further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us get this business up to a net profit of three
thousand a year and then we may talk,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three thou—! Good God, man, I couldn’t talk. I’d
slobber and gibber!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where I’ll come in,” laughed Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had set his heart on this wash-out from the war
making good. Just before Christmas he had an added
incentive. A melancholy lady and a wistful pretty girl
had flashed for a week end through Fanstead. They had
come from London and had put up at The King’s Head.
Radnor had made the tour of the proprietor through the
garage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Mr. Briggs, my foreman, whom I’ve so often
told you about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And afterwards, to Triona, with an air of inconsequence:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A kind of aunt and cousin of mine who wanted to see
how I was getting on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor old chap! Of course they wanted to see how he
was getting on. The girl’s assessing eyes took in everything,
himself included.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unbidden phrase flashed through his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shall marry the girl by Michaelmas Day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden impishness of it delighted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, he shall!” he swore to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he refused an increase of salary and, by following an
<span class='it'>ignis fatuus</span> of an ideal, he kept his conscience in a state
of interested amusement at the mystification of his
employer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>April came and found the Quantock Garage in full tide
of business. Hetherington of “The Bull” had long since
given up his wheezy station car and the motor-destroying
works in which he housed it. Triona laboured from
morning to night, for a while content to see the wheels of
an efficient establishment go round. And then he began
to grow restless. He had set Radnor permanently on
his feet. If he left, the business would go on by its own
momentum. Nothing more was needed than Radnor’s
own conscientious plodding. Why should he stay? He
had achieved his purpose. Radnor would surely be in
a financial position warranting him to marry the girl by
Michaelmas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see him through,” he vowed, and stayed on.
“And then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then? Life once more became a blank. Of late
he had drugged lonely and despairing thoughts by reading.
Books grew into great piles in corners of his loft
above the garage. But reading awoke him to the poignant
craving for expression. He had half a dozen tantalizing
plots for novels in his head, a score of great situations,
a novelist’s gallery of vivid personalities. As to
the latter, he had a superstition. If he gave one a name it
would arise in flesh and blood, insistent on having its
story told. So he shut tempting names resolutely from
his brain; for he had made up his queer mind never to
write another line of romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spring stirred the sap within him. It was a year
now since he had fled from Olivia. What was she doing,
what feeling? Occasionally he called on Mrs. Pettiland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra, he learned, had paid her weekly visit in October,
had occupied his old room, had gone to visit her lunatic
husband, had maintained her impenetrable silence as to
her mistress’s doings. When Mrs. Pettiland had reported
his chauffeur activities, Myra had said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad he has got honest employment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I let him know that you’re here?” Mrs. Pettiland
had asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra had answered in her final way:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no desire to see him and he certainly has no desire
to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra, therefore, had come and gone without his knowledge.
Often he wished that he had met her and wrung
some information from her unwilling lips. And now,
with his purpose accomplished, his heart aching for
change, his spirit craving to pour itself out in tumultuous
words, and his soul crying for her that was lost, the
thought that had haunted the back of his mind for the
past year stood out grimly spectre-wise. What right had
he to live? Olifant had spoken truly. What right had
he to compel her to perpetual widowhood that was no
widowhood? She was tied to him, a husband lost, as far
as she was concerned, to human ken, never to cross her
path again; tied to him as much as Myra was tied to the
poor wretch in the madhouse. And as Myra had grown
soured and hard, so might Olivia grow. Olivia so young
now, with all the joy of life before her. He gone, she
could marry again. There was Olifant, that model of
men, whom he guessed to have supplanted. With him
she could be happy until her life’s end. Once more she
could be Lady Bountiful of “The Towers.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The conception
was an agony of the flesh, keeping him awake of
nights on the hard little camp-bed in the loft. He
grappled with the torture, resolved to triumph over it, as
he had gritted his teeth and triumphed over physical pain
in hospitals. The knife was essential, he told himself.
It was for her sake. It was his duty to put himself out of
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet the days went on, and he felt the lust of life
in his blood. The question tauntingly arose: Is it braver
to die than to live? Is it more cowardly to live than to
die? He couldn’t answer it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime he went on mending broken-down
motor-engines and driving gay tourists about the countryside,
in his car of resurrection.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span><span class='sc'>HAT</span> was bound to happen had happened.
Olifant the Galahad, out for grails, as
Triona, and indeed as Olivia had pictured
him, had lost his head, poured out a flow of mad words,
and flung his arm about her and kissed her passionately.
She had been caught, had half-surrendered; released, she
had put hands to a tumultuous bosom and staggered away
from him. And there had followed a scene enacted for
the twenty-billionth time on the world’s stage. She had
grown weak and strong by turns. At last she had said:
“If you love me, go now and let me think it over and all
that it means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he had gone, passion yielding to his courteous consideration
of her, and she was left alone in the drawing-room,
staring through the open French windows at the
May garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since her return from the South of France, she had felt
the thing coming. In October, as soon as Myra had
returned from her holiday, fear had driven her from
Medlow. The hunger in the man’s eyes proclaimed an
impossible situation. The guest and host position she
had changed after the first few weeks. Brother and sister
and herself kept house together—on the face of it a sensible
and economical arrangement. Mr. Trivett and Mr.
Fenmarch, once more financial advisers, commended it
with enthusiasm. The summer had passed happily
enough. The <span class='it'>modus vivendi</span> with the sections of Medlow
society respectively symbolized by Landsdowne House
and Blair Park had arranged itself automatically. She
found conferred upon her the Freedom of each. The
essential snobbery of English life is a myth kept alive by
our enemies. It is true that the squire and the linen-draper
do not ask each other and their families to dinner.
Their social worlds are apart. They don’t want to ask
each other to dinner. They would never dream of asking
each other to dinner, one no more than the other; they
respect each other too mightily. But a dweller in both
worlds, such as Olivia, Trivett-ed and Gale-d though she
was on the one side, yet on the other, the wife of the
famous Alexis Triona and the friend of the Olifants, folks
whose genealogy was lost somewhere in a Pictish bonfire
of archives, can wander up and down the whole social
gamut at her good pleasure. Besides she herself does not
mix the incompatible. A mere question of the art of life,
which Olivia, with her London experiences found easy of
resolution. So, in the mild and mellow way on which
Medlow prided itself, she had danced and tennis-ed and
picnic-ed the summer through. On the Blair Park side—she
wondered laughingly at their unsupercilious noses—Blaise
Olifant and his sister accompanied her in the gentle
festivities. Each day had brought its petty golden dust—the
futile Church bazaar, the tennis tournament, the
whist-drive of which old John Freke, the linen-draper
father of Lydia, had made her a lady-patroness, the motor-run
into quaint Shrewsbury, on shopping adventure in
quest of crab or lobster unobtainable in Medlow—a thousand
trivial activities—to the innocent choking of her soul,
to use Matthew Arnold’s figure, and an inevitable forgetfullness.
Everything had gone well until October. Then
she had taken prudent flight with Myra to the France and
Italy which she had never seen—and there she had stayed
till the beginning of May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mrs. Woolcombe who insisted on her return to
Medlow. Where else should she return after her wanderings
but to her own home? At first everything was just
as it used to be. Then, on a trivial cause—an insult
offered her by an Italian in Venice which she had laughingly
recounted—the passion of Blaise Olifant had suddenly
flamed forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was frightened, shaken. He had given her
the thrill, which, in her early relations with him
she had half contemptuously deemed impossible.
She found herself free from sense of outrage. She bore
him no resentment. Indeed she had responded to his
kiss. She was not quite sure, within herself, whether she
would not respond again. The communicated thrill
completed her original conception of him as the very perfect
gentle knight. For after all, knights without red-blood
in their veins might be gentle, but scarcely perfect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she were free, she would marry him out of hand,
without further question. He had always dwelt in a
tender spot of her heart. Now he had slipped into one
more warm, smouldering with strange fires. But she was
not free. She stood at once at the parting of the roads.
She must go back to a wandering or lonely life, or she
must defy conventions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went out into the ivy-walled garden, and walked up
the central path, between the beds of wallflowers and forget-me-nots
and the standard roses just bursting into leaf.
What could she do? Once she had laughed scornfully at
the idea of love playing any part in her life. She had not
reckoned with her youth. And now she stared aghast
at the vista of lonely and loveless years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Blaise Olifant came from his study and
advanced to meet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said: “Can you speak to me now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—now,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve behaved like any blackguard. You must forgive
me, if you can. The Italian cad who made me see red
was not very much worse than myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a smile in her dark eyes as she looked up at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s all the difference in the world. I disliked
the Italian very much.” She touched his sleeve. “You
are forgiven, my dear friend. It’s all my fault. I
oughtn’t to have come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the most wonderful of women,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most wonderful of women made a little wry movement
of her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all a might-be and a can’t-be,” she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose, my dear, I don’t know that? If it
could be, do you think I should regret losing my self-control?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said. “If it’s any consolation to you—perhaps I
lost mine too. We’re both human. Perhaps a woman
is even more so than a man. That’s why I went away in
October—things were getting impossible——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” he exclaimed, “I thought you were
bored to death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little laugh could not be restrained. The blindness
of man to psychological phenomena is ever a subject for
woman’s sweet or bitter mirth. But it was not in his
heart to respond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you do care for me a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t be standing here with you now, if I didn’t.
I shouldn’t have made the mistake of coming back, if
I hadn’t wanted to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mistake?” He sighed and turned a step away.
“Yes. I suppose it was. I should have been frank with
Mary and shewn her that it was impossible—for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be best for me to go to-morrow,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“London. A hotel. Any old branch.” She smiled.
“I must settle down somewhere sooner or later. The
sooner the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s monstrous,” he declared with a flash in his
eyes. “To turn you out of your home—I should feel a
scoundrel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how we can go on living together, carrying
on as usual, as though nothing had happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments they walked up the gravelled path
in silence, both bareheaded in the mild May sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” he said, coming to a pause. “I’m a man who
has learned self-control in three hard schools—my Scotch
father’s, science, war. If I swear to you, on my honour,
that nothing that has passed between us to-day shall ever
be revived by me in look or word or act—will you stay
with us, and give me your—your friendship—your companionship—your
presence in the house? It was an
aching desert all the time you were away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked on a pace or two, after a hopeless sigh.
Could she never drive into this unworldly head the fact
that women were not sexless angels? How could their
eyes forever meet in the glance of a polite couple discussing
the weather across a tea-table? She could not resist
a shaft of mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all of your philosopher father and science and
war—I wonder, my dear Blaise, how much you really
know of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He halted and put a hand on her slim shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you so much my dear,” said he, “that I should
be content to hang crucified before you, so that my eyes
could rest upon you till I died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and strode fast away. She followed him
crying “Blaise! Blaise!” He half turned with an arresting
arm—and even at that moment she was touched
by the pathos of the other empty sleeve——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t—please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran hard and facing him blocked his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what of me? What of my feelings while I saw
you hanging crucified?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That point of view had not occurred to him. He
looked at her embarrassed. His Scottish veracity asserted
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When a man’s mad in love,” said he, “he can’t think
of everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took his arm and led him up the gravelled path
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you see, dear, how impossible it all is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I suppose so. It must be one thing or the
other. And all that is good and true and honourable
makes it the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears came at the hopelessness of it. She seized his
hand in both of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you said just now is a thing no woman could
forget to the day of her death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed the hand and let it drop, stirred to the inmost.
What was she, ineffectual failure, to command the
love of such a man? He stood for a while looking into
the vacancy of the pale blue sky over the ivy-clad wall.
Before her eyes garden and house and wall and sky were
blotted out; and only the one tall figure existed in the
scene. Her heart beat. It was a moment of peril, and
the moment seemed like an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he turned and looked at her with his grave
smile. She put her hand on her heart not knowing
whether to cry or laugh at the relaxation of tension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stay here with Mary,” he said gently. “I’ll go
away for a change—a holiday. I need one. There’s an
old uncle of mine in Scotland. I’ve neglected him and
his salmon-fishing shamefully for years. How I can fish
with one arm, heaven only knows. I’ve learned to do
most things. It’ll be a new experience. As a matter of
fact, I should have gone last month, if the temptation to
wait for you hadn’t been so strong. It’s up in the wilds
of Inverness——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made feeble protest. It was she who drove him
out of his home. Far better for her to cut herself adrift
from Medlow. But he prevailed. He would go. In the
meantime things might right themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He departed the following morning, leaving Olivia to
a new sense of loneliness and unrest. She lived constantly
in the tense moment, catching her breath at the
significance of its possibilities. Unbidden and hateful
the question recurred: if positions had been reversed;
if Blaise had been the lost husband and Alexis the lover,
would Alexis have let her go? Certainly not Alexis.
And yet deep down in her heart she was grateful that she
had come scathless through the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little round of country gaieties went on and caught
her up in its mild gyrations. Mrs. Woolcombe deplored
her brother’s absence. He had been looking forward
to the social life with Olivia, especially the tennis parties.
It was wonderful how he had overcome the handicap of
his one arm; the effectual service he had perfected, tossing
up the ball with his racket and smiting it at the dead
point of ascent. It had all been due to Olivia’s encouragement
the previous summer; for till then he had not
played for years. But he had been sadly overworked.
When a man cannot sleep and rises up in the morning
with a band of iron round his head, it is obvious that he
needs a change. It was the best thing for Blaise, undoubtedly;
but it must be dull for Olivia. So spake
Mary Woolcombe, unaware of kisses and tense moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia said to Myra: “This is an idle, meaningless life.
We’ll go back to London and settle down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will life mean much more when you get there?”
asked Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do I know? Why are you so irritating, Myra?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t me,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman wants a man to look after,” said Myra in
her unimpassioned way. “If she can’t get a man she
wants a woman. I’ve got you, so I’m not irritated. You
haven’t got either, so you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia flushed angrily and swerved round in her chair
before the mirror on her toilet-table—Myra was drying
her hair—as she had dried it from days before Olivia
could remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a liberty, Myra, which you oughtn’t to have
taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say, dearie,” replied Myra unmoved, “but it’s
good for you that somebody now and then should tell
you the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want neither man nor woman,” Olivia declared.
Myra gently squared her mistress’s shoulders to the
mirror and went on with her task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re hateful,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. But I’ve got common-sense. If you think
you’re going to London to stand for Parliament or write
poetry and get it printed or run a Home for Incurable
Camels, you’re mistaken, dear. And you’ll have no truck
with women. You’ve never had a woman friend in the
world—anyone you’d die for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I haven’t,” snapped Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a man’s woman you are,” continued Myra.
“You’ve looked after men ever since your dear mother
was taken ill. It’s what God meant you to do. It’s all
you can do. And you haven’t got a man and that’s
what’s making you unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia sprang from her chair, looking with her long
black hair ruffled and frizzed and spreading out around
her warm oval face, like an angry sea-nymph on a rock
disputed by satyrs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate men and everything connected with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You still hate your husband?” asked Myra looking at
her with cold pale eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loathe him. How dare you? Haven’t I forbidden
you to mention his name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mention his name,” said Myra. “But if you
like, I won’t refer to him again. Sit down and let me
put on the electric dryer. Your hair’s still wringing wet.”
She yielded, not with good grace. Myra had her at
her mercy. Dignity counselled instant dismissal of Myra
from her presence. But the washing and drying of her
long thick hair had ever been a problem; so dignity gave
way to comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was furious with Myra. We all are with people
who confront us with the naked truth about ourselves.
That was all she was fit for; all that life had taught her;
to look after a man. She stared at the blatant proposition
in the grimness of the night-watches. What else, in
God’s name, was she capable of doing for an inch
advancement of humanity? She had gone forth long ago—so
it seemed—from Medlow, to open the mysterious
mysteries of the world. She had opened them—and all
the pearls, good, bad and indifferent, were men. All the
ideals; all the colour and music and gorgeous edifices of
life; all the world vibration of thought and action and
joy of which she had dreamed, every manifold thrill that
had run through her being from feet to hair on that first
night in London when she had leaned out of her Victoria
Street flat and opened her young soul to the informing
spirit of the vast city of mystery—the whole spiritual
meaning, nay, the whole material reason for her existence,
was resolved into one exquisitely pure, bafflingly translucent
in its mystery of shooting flames, utterly elemental
crystal of sex. Sex, in its supreme purity; but sex all the
same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a man’s woman. It was at once a glory and
a degradation. Myra was right. What woman, in the
course of her life, had she cared a scrap for? Her
mother. Her mother was a religion. And men? Her
chastity revolted. When had she sought to attract men?
Her conscience was clear. But men had been the terror,
the interest, the delight of her life from the moment she
had left the cloistral walls of her home. And even before
that, on a different plane, had she not, while keeping
house for father and brothers, always thought in terms
of man?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now she was doing the same. The emptiness of
her prospective life in London appalled her. The mad
liar, her husband, an unseizable, unknown entity, of
whom she thought with shivering repulsion, was away
somewhere, living a strange, unveracious life. The
soldier, scholar and gentleman, who loved her, into whose
arms, into whose life, she had all but fallen, had fled,
saving her from perils. Before he returned she must, in
decency and honour, take up her solitary abode elsewhere.
Or else she could terminate his tenancy of “The Towers”
and carry on an old-maidish life in Medlow for evermore.
Anyway, a useless sexless thing for all eternity.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The second post had brought her some letters, a few
bills and receipts, a note from Janet Philimore with
whom she kept up a casual correspondence, and a long
untidy screed from Lydia. Lydia had conceived the idea
of visiting Medlow. Her father, old John Freke, whom
she had not seen for years, was ailing. What did Olivia
think of the notion? Olivia, sitting in the little ivy-clad
summer-house at the end of the garden, thought less of
the notion than of the amazing lady. To ask her, an
outsider, whether she should come to her father’s bed of
sickness! She made up her mind to write: “Oh, yes,
come at once, but wear the thickest of black veils, so
that no one will recognize you.” Her mind wandered
away from the hypothetical visit—London and Lydia
again! Just where she was when she started. Life
seemed a hopeless muddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Myra’s voice breaking suddenly on
her meditations. She looked up and beheld Myra more
than usually grave and cold. “I’m sorry to disturb you.
But I’ve just had a letter. He’s dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, with a shock through all her being, started to
her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead. My husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Myra. “Mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Olivia somewhat breathless—and sank on
the bench again. She recovered herself quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Myra. But after all, it’s a merciful
release.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s mercies are inscrutable,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, thought Olivia, was Myra’s remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve always loved him, you see,” said Myra. “I suppose
you’ll have no objections to my going to bury him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear old Myra,” cried Olivia. “Of course, my
dear, you can go—go whenever you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come back as soon as it’s over,” said Myra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned and walked away, and Olivia saw her lean
and unexpressive shoulders rise as though a sob had
shaken her.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span><span class='sc'>F</span> the death of Myra Stebbings’s husband and
of her second appearance in Pendish during his
sojourn in the West Country, Triona knew nothing.
Again she had forbidden her sister-in-law to give
him any information as to her doings. Again she disclaimed
interest in the young man. Nor was he aware,
a week after the funeral, that Myra, who had stood by
the graveside in the pouring rain, and had insisted on
jogging back to Pendish wet through, in the undertaker’s
brougham, lay dangerously ill in the upstairs bedroom
of the little Georgian house. The increasing business of
the Quantock Garage diverted his energies from polite
tramps into Pendish to enquire into Mrs. Pettiland’s
state of health. Also, he was growing morose, his soul
feeding on itself, and beginning to develop an unwholesome
misanthropy. Like Hamlet, man didn’t delight
him; no, nor woman neither. When not working in the
garage or driving the old touring-car, he retired to brood
in his loft and eschewed the company of his kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re overdoing it,” said Radnor, a kindly person.
“Why not go away on a holiday and have a change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one change would do me any good,” he replied
gloomily, “and that would be to get out of this particularly
vile universe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Radnor looked round his well ordered, bustling establishment
and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t as bad as all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triona shrugged his shoulders and spanner in hand
turned to the car he was doctoring, without a reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days afterwards Radnor said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to be married in August, and I don’t
mind saying it’s mostly thanks to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to hear it,” said Triona. “I’ll stick it out
till then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have the change you’ve been talking of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Radnor laughed. “You’ll let me have a bit of a
honeymoon first, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” replied Triona. “You can have your
honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weakening incentive to life would last till September.
He would make it last. It was now the beginning
of June. Three months or so more wouldn’t
matter. To carry on a meaningless existence further
would be absurd. Indeed, it would be immoral. Of
that, for some time past he had convinced himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>England ran motor-mad that summer. It awoke to find
war restrictions removed, roads free and petrol to be
had for the buying. In its eagerness to race through a
beloved land closed up for years and view or review
historic spots of loveliness, and otherwise to indulge in
its national vagabond humour it cared little for the price
of petrol. The hiring garages, in anything like tourist
centres, found their resources strained. Radnor bought
another car, and still had more orders than he could
execute. He drove one car himself.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was a soft June evening. Triona sat at the wheel
of the great antiquated touring-car to which he had given
its new lease of life, driving homewards from the neighbourhood
of the Great Junction Town. He had taken a
merry party that day some hundred and fifty miles
through the tenderest greenery of early summer, through
dark gorges with startling shadows, through cool lanes,
over hills in the open sunshine; and, in the sweetness of
the evening, he had put them down at the place whence
they had started. For all his mood of despair, he had
enjoyed the day. The poet in him had responded to the
eternal call of the year’s life laughing in its gay insolence
of youth. Since nine in the morning the sweet wind of
the hills had swept through his lungs and scenes of loveliness
had shimmered before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alone at the wheel, he thought of the passing day of
beauty. Was it not worth living—just to enjoy it? Was
it not worth living—just to translate into words, if only
for the sake of the doing, the emotion of that enjoyment?
He had passed through a beech wood, a world of pale
emerald, like fairy seas, above, and a shimmer of blue-bells
below as though the sky had been laid down for a
carpet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drove slowly and carefully. The car had done
its good day’s work. It was knocking a bit, like an old
horse wheezing in protest against over-estimation of its
enduring powers. He had tried it perhaps too high to-day.
He loved the re-created old car, as though it were
a living thing. A valiant old car, which had raced over
awful roads in Flanders. It was a crazy irritation that
he could not pat it into comfort. Nursing it with the
mechanician’s queer tenderness, he came to the straight
mile, near home, of road on the mountain side, with its
sheer drop into the valley, ending at the turn known as
Hell’s Corner, at which the overwrought doctor, on the
night of mad adventure, had lost his nerve. Just past
the corner branched the secondary road to Fanstead,
for the great road swept on by the expiring end of Pendish
village; but by walking from Pendish, as he had
done on the day of the aforesaid adventure, through
lanes and fields, one cut off a great bend of road and
struck it on the fair-mile beyond the turn. And now a
few hundred yards from the corner the engine gave
trouble. He descended from his seat and opened the
bonnet. He discovered a simple matter, the choking of a
plug. The knocking, he knew was in the cardan shaft.
He would have to replace the worn pin. While cleaning
out the choked plug with a piece of wire and blowing
through it to clear it from the last fragment of grit, he
wondered how long it would take to have the spare pin
made. He was going out again the day after to-morrow.
Could he risk the old car? To-morrow he would take
her down and see for himself the full extent of the trouble.
Meanwhile he screwed the plug on again, shut down the
bonnet, cranked up the starting handle and jumped up
beside the wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just as he put in the low gear, his eyes were riveted
on a familiar figure some twenty yards away, walking
towards him. For a moment or two he remained paralysed,
while the old-fashioned gears crunched horribly.
There she advanced slim, erect, in Tussore silk coat and
skirt, a flash of red bow at the opening of her blouse.
The car began to move. At that instant their eyes met.
Olivia staggered back, and he read in her bewildered gaze
the same horror he had last seen in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What she was doing here, on this strip of remote road,
he could not understand. Obviously she had not expected
to find him, for she looked at him as though he
were some awful ghost. He changed gear, went full
speed ahead and passed her in a flash. Then suddenly,
the command of doom shot through his brain. This was
the end. Now was the end that should have come, had
he not been a coward, months ago. He deliberately
swerved off the road and went hurtling over the hill-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia staring, wide-eyed, wondering, at the racing car,
saw it happen. It was no accident. It was deliberate.
Her brain reeled at the sudden and awful horror. She
swayed to the bank and fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A two-seater car, a young man and woman in it, came
upon her a few moments later and drew up. The woman
ministered to her and presently she revived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has been a horrible accident,” she explained
haggardly. “A car went over—you can see the wheel
marks—Oh my God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed. A column of smoke was rising from the
valley into the still evening air. She scrambled to unsteady
feet, and started to run. The young man detained
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The car will take us quicker. Maggie, you drive.
I’ll stand on the footboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They swiftly covered the hundred yards or so to the
scene of the catastrophe. And there thirty feet below in
the ravine the old car was burning amid the heavy vapour
of petrol smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick,” cried Olivia, “let us get down! He may still
be alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man shook his head. “Not much chance,
poor devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know him?” asked the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my husband,” cried Olivia tragic-eyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all plunged down the slope, the young man going
straight in the ruts of the leaping car. Olivia, after a
fall or two, ran gropingly to side levels, catching hold of
bushes to aid her descent, her brain too scorched with
the terror of that which lay below, for coherent thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again her light, high-heeled shoes tripped her on the
smooth grass and she slithered down a few yards. And
then, as she steadied herself once more on her feet, she
heard a voice from behind a clump of gorse:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just my damned luck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her knees shook violently. She wanted to shriek, but
she controlled herself and, staggering round the gorse
bush, came upon Alexis, seated on a hummock, his head
between his hands. He looked up at her stupidly; and
she, with outspread fingers on panting bosom:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God, you’re not dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know so much about that,” said he, rising to
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman of the car who had been following
Olivia more or less in her descent, appeared from behind
the bush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, too, thanked God. He had been saved by a miracle.
How had he escaped?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A providence which looks after idiots caused me to
be hurled out of the car at the first bump. I fell into
the gorse. I’m not in the least bit hurt. Please don’t
worry about me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must let us drive you home—I’ll call my husband,”
said the young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you very much,” said he, “but I’m perfectly
sound and I’d rather walk; but this lady seems to have
had a shock and no doubt——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman, perplexed, turned to Olivia. “You
said this—gentleman—” for Alexis stood trim in brass-buttoned
and legginged chauffeur’s livery—“you said he
was your husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A case of mistaken identity,” he replied suavely.
Olivia, her brain in a whirl, said nothing. The young
woman advanced a few steps and coo-eed to the young
man who had just reached the ravine. As he turned on
her hail, she halloed the tidings that all was well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be here in a few minutes,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood an embarrassed trio. Alexis explained
how the steering-rod, which had given him trouble all
day, had suddenly snapped. It had been the affair of a
moment. As for the car, it was merely a kind of land
ark fitted with a prehistoric internal combustion engine.
Insured above its value. The proprietor would be delighted
to hear the end of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man joined them, out of breath. Explanations
had to be given <span class='it'>da capo</span>. Again Good Samaritan
offers to put their two-seater at the disposal of the derelicts.
With one in the back seat they could crowd three
in front. They were going to Cullenby, twenty miles on,
but a few miles out of their way, if need be, were neither
here nor there. A very charming, solicitous, well-run
young couple. Olivia scarcely knew whether to shriek at
them to go away, or to beg them to remain and continue
to save a grotesque situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Triona repeated his thanks and declined the
proffered lift. Walking would do him all the good in
the world; would steady his nerves after his calamitous
bump. The young man eyed him queerly. It was a
strange word for a chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you would take this lady,” said Triona again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia recovered her wits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will walk too, if you don’t mind. I’m only a mile
from home. And this gentleman is really my husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can really do nothing more?” The young
man raised his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thousand thanks for all your kindness,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very mystified young couple left them and remounted
the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subjects of their mystification stood for a while
in silence. Presently Olivia, whose limbs not yet recovered
from the shock trembled so that her knees
seemed to give her no support, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think we might sit down for a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you will,” said Alexis, seating himself on his hummock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cast herself down on the slope and closed her eyes
for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did that on purpose,” she said at last. “You
don’t suppose I believe the story of the broken steering-rod?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled with some bitterness. Fate was for ever
against him. The moment they met in this extravagant
way, there started up the barrier of a lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t very well scare those young folks with a
confession of attempted suicide, could I? After all, the
naked truth may at times be positively indecent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you intended to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said he. “But it ended, like every other
Great Adventure I’ve attempted in my life, in burlesque.
I assure you, that when I found myself pitched into this
clump of gorse and able to pick myself up with nothing
worse than a gasping for breath, I—well—the humiliation
of it!—I cursed the day I was born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you do it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had scarcely regained balance. The situation
seemed unreal. But a few minutes ago he had been far
from her thoughts, which were concerned with the woman
to whose possibly dying bed she had been summoned,
with the dreary days at Medlow now that Blaise Olifant
had gone, with the still beauty of the hills and their
purple sunset shadows. And now, here she was, alone
with him, remote from the world, conversing as dispassionately
as though he had returned from the dead—as
indeed he had almost returned. At her question, he
threw his chauffeur’s cap on the grass and passed his
hand over his hair. The familiar gesture, the familiar
nervous brown hand brought her a step nearer to reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can’t guess, it is useless for me to tell you,”
he said. “You wouldn’t believe me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took out a cigarette. She noted a trembling of
the fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind?” She nodded, he lit the cigarette. “I
thought here, at any rate, I was hidden from you for
the rest of my life. It wouldn’t have been very long
anyway. I had made up my mind some day soon to set
you free of me—and to-day or to-morrow—what did it
matter? I don’t ask you to believe that either. I don’t
see how you can believe a word I say. I gave you to
understand, that I was in Poland—you find me here.
When did Myra tell you I was here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning sanity had corrected his first mad impression.
How could she be a mile from Pendish if she had
not heard from Myra? But she regarded him open-mouthed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra? What has Myra to do with it? Of course
I had no conception you were here? I knew you were
not in Poland. A man—a Pole—I forget his name—wrote
to Major Olifant, last year, wondering what had
become of you. You had never joined him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boronowski,” said Triona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was the name——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you took it for granted I had lied to him too.”
Her eyes dropped beneath his half sad, half ironic gaze.
She made a little despairing gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Myra never told you anything about me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t answered my question,” she said,
straightening herself: “Where does Myra come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s rather a long story. I should prefer her to
tell it to you. Myra knows everything about me since
the day after you received my last letter over a year
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned forward, an angry spot burning on both
cheeks. “Myra has been hiding you here all the time
and has told me nothing about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has her excellent reasons. She will tell you in a
very few words——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can’t. At any rate not now. She has been very
ill with pneumonia. They thought she was dying and
sent for me. Why otherwise should I be here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you staying at Mrs. Pettiland’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t even know Myra was in Pendish—I’m
grieved to hear she’s ill. I’m afraid I’ve neglected Mrs.
Pettiland of late. She was very kind to me.” He
paused and added with a smile, “I see Myra’s loyalty.
She forbade Mrs. Pettiland to mention the name of the
young man called Briggs. You’ve never heard of such
a person at Pendish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word,” said Olivia. “But I shall never forgive
Myra. Never, never,” she cried indignantly. “To
fool me like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught sudden hope from the flash in her dark eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you have liked to know where I was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate duplicity. I thought that Myra, at least—my
God! Is there anybody in the world one can trust?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she turned on him. “What are you doing in
that absurd livery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been earning my living in it, since last August.
I’ve done it before. It’s an honester way than many
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, if I don’t understand,” she said, still
half-bewildered. “You have no need to earn your living
by driving a car—a common chauffeur—unless——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She checked herself with a little gasp—but his quick
brain divined her impulsive thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless I had taken to drink and gone to the bad, etcetera,
etcetera——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She interrupted him quickly. “No, no. I never
thought that. It was a <span class='it'>reductio ad absurdum</span>. But on
what other hypothesis——? You’ve still your brain,
your talent, your genius. Your pen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is mightier than the wheel,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why you didn’t go to Poland. Perhaps
you’ll explain. Anyhow you didn’t. You came here—to
the absolute quiet of the country. Why haven’t you gone
on writing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the simple reason,” said he, “that Alexis Triona
and all his works are dead. Washed out from the Book
of Life. That side of me is all over and done with. You
who know everything, can’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught the note of truth in his words and gradually
there began to dawn on her the immensity of his
artist’s sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that you’re never going to write again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” said he. “Does this look like it?” and he
touched the brass buttons on his livery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She weakened through impatience at his aloofness,
craving to know all that had happened to him, to get to
the roots of Myra’s mysterious intrigue. His fatalistic
attitude was maddening. The whole crazy combination
of tragedy and farce that had set them down in the
gorse-enclosed hollow of the hill-side, as though they
were the only people on God’s earth, was maddening.
The brass buttons were maddening. She flung sudden
arms out wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake tell me everything that has happened
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll believe it,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat silent for a moment, feeling as though she were
under his rebuke, and gazed over the valley at the hills
black beneath the dying green and faded orange of the
sunset. The thin smoke of the burned car mounted into
the windless air faint with the smell of petrol fumes and
scorched woodwork. And Triona looked down too and
saw the end of the creation of his resurrection. He
pointed to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was one of my little dreams,” he said gently.
“A sort of rat trap on wheels—the most hopeless box of
antiquated imbecility you can imagine. I took it into
my head to recreate it. For a time I devoted my soul to
it—and I made it a thing of life and speed and obedience.
And there it lies dead, a column of smoke, like all dreams
and, all my deliberate fault. Every system of philosophy,
since the world began, has overlooked the ironical
symbolism of life. That’s one; and my dream—smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell under the spell of his voice, although her
brain revolted. Yet his note rang sincere in her heart—she
knew not what to say. The sunset colours over the
ridge of hills died into iron blue of the sky. A faint
breeze stirred. She shivered with cold in her thin Tussore
silk. He, watching her, saw the shiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re cold, you must be getting back.” He rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet before he could help her to rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see you to Mrs. Pettiland’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They scrambled to the high road above them, and began
to walk, in constrained silence. Suddenly she
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve hurt yourself. You’re limping dreadfully.
You told me you were unhurt——” She clutched his
arm. “You can’t go on like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go on like this,” said he, thrilling under her touch,
“to the day of my death. It has nothing to do with this
evening’s entertainment. I was smashed up by a motor-lorry
over a year ago, as Myra will tell you. That’s
what knocked me out of Poland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She echoed his words—“Smashed up by a motor-lorry?—It
might have killed you—and I should have
never known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra would have told you. As a matter of fact it
very nearly did kill me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her head away with a shudder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And just now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to have waited till I had turned the corner—”
he pointed out the bend a few yards in front of them.
“Hell’s Corner, they call it hereabouts. Then you
wouldn’t have seen me go over, and I might have had
better luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her turn deadly white, reel, and he tried to
support her; but she slipped away from him and sat by
the wayside. She thought she was going to faint again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, don’t talk like that. It’s inhuman.
It’s unlike you. Even if you were a stranger it would be
horrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only apologising for my existence,” he said.
“Fate has been against me—but, believe me, I have done
my best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while she rose, declaring herself better, and
they struck off the road down the twisting lane that led to
Pendish. The air was fragrant in the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about that accident—how Myra came to
know of it. I suppose you sent her word?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps when you have talked to Myra, you’ll credit
me at least with sincere intentions. If I had informed
her, it would have been an indirect appeal to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it would have been wiser to appeal to me
direct,” said Olivia tonelessly. “I’m not devoid of common
humanity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t have done that,” he said gently. “I lay
unconscious for weeks. When I came to my senses I
found Myra had come the second morning I was in
hospital. I had better begin with my meeting with the
Pole, Boronowski—it’s a simple matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To him, walking with this lost wife of his dreams, in
the lovers’ lane, the hour seemed fantastic. His voice
sounded unreal in his ears. His heart lying heavy as
lead within him was not the heart that he had thought
would beat furiously at the ravishing sight of her. He
told his story badly; just the salient facts, uninspired by
the dramatic instinct which had made him colour so
vividly the narration, a year ago, to Mrs. Pettiland, of
his ridiculous adventure. This he barely sketched. For
truth’s sake he must tell her of the robbery and account
for his penniless condition. It was not himself talking.
It was not Olivia to whom he talked. One stranger’s
personality was talking through him to another’s. At
the end of the tale:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have changed greatly,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very possible.” There was a pause. He continued.
“And you? Forgive me. I haven’t even asked
whether you are well——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve been all right. I spent the winter abroad,
and now I’m staying with Mrs. Woolcombe at ‘The
Towers.’ Major Olifant is away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came up suddenly against the wicket-gate of
Mrs. Pettiland’s garden. A light shone through the yet
undrawn curtains in his old bedroom. He raised an
enquiring hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I’m in Mrs. Pettiland’s room in the front. She
would give it up to me. I’ve been helping to nurse—as
well as I can. I’ve been in all day. That’s why I came
out for a walk this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited, hoping against hope, for a word revoking
his sentence. None came. The steel sinew that ran
through him, and was answerable for all his accomplishment,
stiffened. He would make no appeal <span class='it'>ad misericordiam</span>.
He had suffered enough in expiation. He had
come to the end of his tether. For pity masking the last
year’s hatred and contempt he had no use. He opened
the gate for her. She passed in and he closed it and the
click of the latch sounded like the crack of finality; for
Olivia, taken almost unawares, as for Triona. They
stood for a while, the wooden barrier between them, in
the gathering darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impulsively she exclaimed: “We can’t part like this,
with a thousand things unexplained.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m at your orders, Olivia,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught her breath and stiffened. “We must talk
to-morrow—when we have both recovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be here any hour you name,” said Alexis. Radnor
and his garage could go to the devil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine o’clock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine o’clock,” said he. “Good night, Olivia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memory of the scandal crashed down on her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well tell you now—the night may bring
counsel—I’m in a terrible position. Wedderburn and
Onslow—you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him rapidly of her pledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter a scrap to me, but it’s a damnable
thing for you,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What answer would you make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A clean breast of everything. Could you wish me to
do anything else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” she replied. “Give me time to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My time is yours, Olivia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused for a moment irresolute. There was a
question she wished to put, but the thought of it made her
feel sick and faint again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not do anything foolish, till I see you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor anything wise,” said he. “I promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there came between them a long embarrassed
silence. At last——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Olivia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung an angry hand in the darkness and slipped
away into the house.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span><span class='sc'>RS. PETTILAND</span> met her at the foot of the
stairs. She beamed rosily beneath the gas
jet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra is so much better, Madam, after her sleep.
The doctor came while you were out. I’m to make her
some chicken broth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia mounted the stairs and entered the sick-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well dearie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to the gaunt waxen face on the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad to hear the doctor’s good report.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She forced herself to linger, speaking the commonplaces
of the sick-room. Then she could bear it no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m dead tired,” she said. “I’ll go to bed. Nurse
ought to be here soon. Have you everything you want
for the night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra said in her even tones: “Have <span class='it'>you</span> everything
you want for the night?” And at Olivia’s quick glance
of enquiry: “You look as if you’d seen a ghost. You
have. I was afraid of it. I didn’t want them to send
for you, but I was too ill to stop them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia could not wreak her anger yet on the frail
woman. But in her heart burned a furious indignation.
She controlled her voice, and said as gently as she could:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why have you left me in ignorance for the past
year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was biding my time,” said Myra. “I was waiting
for a sign and a token.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From you, dearie. I had him here in the hollow of
my hand. If you had wanted him, I could have given
him to you. But you didn’t want him—so you said.
I wasn’t so sure.” She stretched her thin hand on the
blanket, but Olivia stood, too much enwrapped in her
thoughts to notice the appeal. “When I first saw him
in hospital I hoped that he would die and set you free.
But when I saw him convalescent, my heart was full
of pity for him, and I repented of the sin of committing
murder in my heart. And when I heard from my sister
in-law that he was facing life like a brave man, I
wondered whether I had been wrong and whether you
had been wrong. If I say something to you, will you be
angry with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia shrugged her shoulders. “Say anything you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weak, even voice went on. “If Major Olifant
hadn’t left us, I should have told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia leaped at the thrust, her cheeks flaming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra! How dare you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thin lips parted in a half smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever known me not to dare anything for
your good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra, with all the privileges of illness, had her at a
disadvantage. Olivia was silenced. She unpinned her
hat and threw it on a chair and sat by the bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that you acted for the best, Myra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only her cheeks, but her body flamed at what
seemed now the humiliating allusion. Myra was fully
aware, if not of the actual kiss—oh, no—nothing horrible
of servant’s espionage in Myra—at any rate of the emotionality
in which it had culminated—on her part sex,
sense, the unexpected thrill, the elemental between man
and woman, the hunger for she knew not what—but superficial,
tearing at her nerves, but never, oh, never touching
the bed-rock of her spiritual being. A great passionate
love for Blaise, she knew, Myra with her direct
vision, would have understood. For the assurance of her
life’s happiness Myra would have sacrificed her hope of
eternal salvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the worn woman who had had but one’s week’s
great fulfilment of love in her life, knew what love meant,
and she had sounded the shallows of her pitiful love—if
love it could be called—for Blaise Olifant; and now,
in her sad, fatalistic way she shewed her the poor markings
of the lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you have seen him?” asked Myra quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes I’ve seen him. God knows how you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her overstrained soul gave way. She broke into uncontrollable
crying and sobbing, her little dark head on
the blanket by Myra’s side. And after a little came incoherent
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve lost him—He doesn’t care for me any more—He
hates me—He tried to kill himself when he saw
me—He was driving a car and put it over a precipice—Thank
God—a miracle—he wasn’t hurt—But he might
have killed himself—He meant to—And it’s all your
fault—all your fault—If only you had told me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra put her thin hand on the dear dark hair and
caressed it till the paroxysm was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loved a thing that was scarcely a man till the day
of his death, for I had memories, dearie, of him when
he was a man to be loved. You’ve got a living man for
a husband. And you loved yours as much as I loved
mine. And he’s a living and suffering man. Go to
him—” her hand still played feebly caressing the black
mass of her hair. “Fate has brought you together again.
He’s your man, whom you vowed to help in sickness or in
health. I kept mine in sickness. Thank God, your man’s
sickness is nothing like mine. Go to him, dearie. Humble
yourself if need be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve been very ill. I’ve
thought and thought and thought—I’ve an idea that illness
clears one’s brain—and all my thoughts have been
for you. For me there’s nothing left. I’ve thought of
him and you. I’ve thought of what he has done and
what you have done—And, with all his faults, he’s a
bigger human being than you are, dearie. Go to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia raised a tragic face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I? He doesn’t want me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man doesn’t try to kill himself for a woman he
doesn’t want. You had better go to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Olivia went. She slipped out of the house at
eleven o’clock, after a couple of hours of wrestling with
ugly and vain devils. Who was she, after all? What had
she done to add a grain to the world’s achievement?
What had she found in her adventure into the world that
had been worth the having save the love of the man that
was her husband? Many phases of existence had passed
procession-wise through her life. All hollows and shams.
The Lydian galley, with its Mavennas and Bobby Quintons.
The mad Blenkirons. The gentle uninspiring
circle of little Janet Philimore. The literary and artistic
society for the few months of Alexis’s lionization—pleasant,
but superficial, always leaving her with the sense
of having fallen far short of a communion that might
have been. Nothing satisfying but the needs and the
childish wants and the work and the uplifting spirit of
the one man. And after the great parting what had there
been? Her life in Medlow devoid of all meaning—Her
six months travel—a feeding of self to no purpose.
An existence of negativity. Blaise Olifant. She flamed,
conscious of one thing at last positive, and positive for ill.
She had played almost deliberately with fire. Otherwise
why had she gone back to Medlow? She had brought unhappiness
to a very noble gentleman. It had been in his
power, as a man, to sweep her off her feet in a weak hour
of clamouring sex. He had spared her—and she now was
unutterably grateful. For she had never loved him.
She could not love him. His long straight nose. She
grew half hysterical. Even when he had kissed her she
had been conscious of that long straight nose. She withered
at the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped out of the house into the soft night. Pendish,
with its double line of low, whitewashed, thatched
cottages, one a deep shadow, the other clear in the
moonlight, lay as still as a ghostly village of the middle
ages. The echo of her light footsteps frightened her.
Surely windows would fly open and heads peer out
challenging the disturber of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was going to him. Why, she scarcely knew. Perhaps
through obedience to Myra. Myra’s bloodless lips,
working in the waxen, immobile face lit, if dull glimmer
could be called light, by the cold china blue eyes, had
uttered words little less than oracular. Myra had been
waiting for a sign or a token from her that had never
come. She walked through the splendid silence of the
country road, beneath the radiance of a moon above the
hills illuminating a mystery of upland and vale shrouded
in the vaporous garments of the land asleep. Hurrying
along the white ribbon of road she was but a little dark
dot on the surface of a serenely scornful universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was going to him. He was her man. All that she
knew of the meaning of existence came from him. Moonlight
and starlight and the mystery of the night shimmering
through its veil of enchantment faded from her eyes.
She felt nervous arms around her and kisses on her lips,
and she heard him speaking the winged words of imagination,
lifting her into his world of genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man doesn’t try to kill himself for a woman he
doesn’t want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So spake Myra. Olivia walked, the dull tones in which
the words were uttered thudding in her ears. It was her
one hope of salvation. Kill himself! This was not a
falsehood. She had seen the act with her own horror-stricken
eyes. She remembered a phrase of Blaise Olifant’s: “He
is being blackmailed by one lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She realized, with sudden shock, her insignificant loneliness
in the midst of this vast moonlit silence of the
earth. In presence of the immensities she was of no account.
For the first time she became aware of her own
failure. She had been weighed in the balance of her
love for her husband and had been found wanting. In
the hour of his bitter trial, she had failed him. In the
hour when a word of love, of understanding, which meant
forgiveness, would have saved him, she had put him from
her. She had lived on her own little vanities without
thought of the man’s torture. She had failed him then.
She had failed him to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man doesn’t try to kill himself for a woman he
doesn’t want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She strode on, her cheeks burning. All that of extravagance
which he had done this past year had been
for her sake. For all wrong he had done her, he had
sought the final expiation in death. She had failed him
again in this supreme crisis. She had whined to Myra
that he no longer loved her. And she had not given him—that
which even Myra was waiting for—a sign and a
token.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was going to him, nearing him. Already she entered
the straggling end of Fanstead. How would he
receive her? If he cast her off, she would perish in self-contempt.
She went on. An unsuspecting Mrs. Pettiland
had told her, in answer to a question which she
strove to keep casual, the whereabouts of the Quantock
Garage. The sign above an open gateway broke suddenly
on her vision. She entered a silent courtyard.
A light was burning in a loft above a closed garage, and
a wooden flight of steps ran up to it. The door was open
and on the threshold sat a man, his feet on the top stair,
his head buried in his hands. She advanced, her heart
in her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon shone full on him. She uttered a little whispering
cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alexis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started to his feet, gazed at her for a breathless
second and scrambled with grotesque speed down the
rickety staircase and caught her in his arms.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>She mounted the stairs to his loft, furnished with pallet
bed and camp washing apparatus, a wooden chair, a table
bearing unsightly remains of crust and cheese, and littered
with books in corners and on the uncarpeted floor.
All her remorse and pity and love gushed over him—over
the misery of the life to which she had condemned
him by her littleness of soul and her hardness of heart.
She did not spare herself; but of this profanity he would
hear nothing. She had come to him. She had forgiven
him. The Celestial Hierarchy would be darkened by
the presence of one so radiantly angelic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clutched him tight to her. “Oh, my God, if you
had been killed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exultant, he cried in his old way: “Nothing could
kill me, for I was born for your love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked through the night into the sweet-scented
June dawn. They would face the world fearlessly together.
First the Onslow and Wedderburn challenge
to be taken up. She would stand by his side through all
the obloquy. That was the newer meaning of her life.
If they were outcasts what did it matter? They could
not be other than splendidly outcast. He responded in
his eager way to her enthusiasm. <span class='it'>Magna est veritas et
prævalebit.</span> With never a shadow between them, what
ecstasy would be existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crept downstairs like children into the summer
morning.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But as they had planned so did it not turn out. Rowington
gave news that Onslow and Wedderburn had dropped
the question. Why revive dead controversy? But
Triona and Olivia insisted. The letter on the origin of
<span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span>, signed “John Briggs” appeared
in <span class='it'>The Times</span>. A few references to it appeared in the
next weekly Press. But that was all. No one was
interested. <span class='it'>Through Blood and Snow</span> was forgotten.
The events of 1917 in Russia were ancient history.
As well worry over fresh scandals concerning Catherine
the Great. What did the reading world care what Alexis
Triona’s real name was, or how he had obtained the material
for his brilliant book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This summary of the effect of attempted literary and
social suicide was put clearly before them in a long letter
from Rowington a month or so afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we want another novel from Alexis Triona.
When are we going to get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had stayed on indefinitely at Pendish, ostensibly
awaiting Myra’s complete convalescence, and incidentally,
as they told themselves, having their second honeymoon.
At first she took it for granted that he would resign his
post at the Quantock Garage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to begin life again by breaking my
word,” said he. “I promised to see him over his honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a bit mad and Quixotic,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’s all that’s worth having in life, my dear,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she had settled down for the time with her chauffeur
husband, and meanwhile had been feeding him into
health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They read the letter together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use,” wrote Rowington, “to start again under
the Briggs name. You’ve told the world that Triona
is a pseudonym. Alexis Triona means something. John
Briggs doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s quite right,” said Olivia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you will,” he said. “I give in. But you can’t
say I’ve not done my very best to kill Alexis Triona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you can’t. Fate again. And—Alexis dear—I
never knew John Briggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in the sea-haunted parlour. After a while
he took up the pink conch-shell and fingered it lovingly.
Then, with a laugh, he put it to her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened a while, handed him back the shell and
looking up at him out of her dark eyes, laughed the laugh
of deep happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go with you, dear—to any South Sea Island you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you?” he cried. “We’ll go. And I’ll write a
novel full of the beauty of God’s Universe and you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myra came in to lay the luncheon table. Olivia leaped
up and threw her arms around the thin shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myra dear, you’ll have to pack up quick. We’re
going to Honolulu to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must make it the day after,” said Myra. “The
laundry doesn’t come till to-morrow night.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
